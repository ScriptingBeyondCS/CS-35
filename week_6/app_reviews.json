They also could have had better or more tune options, they only offered 'rock', country', and 'pop', which I thought were horrible for this children's song. I do like that it's interactive. Everything you touch in the room does something different. Phone rings, dog chases the cat, door opens, clock goes off, etc.....neat. My daughter also enjoys all the other interactive features it has other than the monkeys falling off the bed. &#34;Wheels on the bus&#34; app by &#34;duck duck moose&#34; ranks higher because you have much more options like changing the language, gender voice options, instrumental, and self record which my daughter finds hilarious when she hears her own voice.  Overall it's ok and she likes to see the monkeys fall off the bed."

    "reviewText": "I have used most every subscription music service and when it comes to their apps, Rhapsody's offers one of the best experiences. While Spotify revolves heavily around playlists and radio, Rhapsody has both and a whole lot more. It is much easier to navigate and find the music you are looking for and it includes easy access to your saved music library. Plus you can download individual tracks, albums, and playlists for offline play. Both the interface and visual appearance are very nice. The sound quality tops out at 192 kbps AAC+, which is not as high as some services, but sounds great from my experience. There is a lower setting if you need to save data usage. Any song in their library can be listened to on-demand (or as part of a playlist or radio station) through their app. All ad-free.The service itself requires a subscription, currently $10 per month. While they do have free trials, they do not currently have a free version of the service. So if you are not interested in subscribing or giving it a trial run, then this app is probably not for you.I use this app on my first generation Kindle Fire and so far no complaints."

    "reviewText": "I did the 7-day trial and was impressed, but am continuing my search for the best music app. Pros: tons of selection (but every music app has that); my account worked on the phone and online (at least for the trial; not sure if that applies afterwards); download to play off-line (while you have the service, obviously); decent UI (I made the buttons larger for in-car use); decent arrangement of genres with descriptions, key artists, key albums, key songs; info about artists is reasonably detailed; radio stations (though lots of music apps have those); tracking of songs played (though that seemed to be online only); recommendations are ok. Cons: songs did lots of skipping/jumping, even when I had 4 bars & 4G, and even online (though songs sometimes continued when coverage was bad); lacks the customization of thumbs up/down that I grew used to in Pandora; playlist UI isn't helpful - it shows a big view of the album of the currently playing song, then the list rolls of the screen, with no view of the upcoming song (you have to scroll all the way down the list); no lockscreen control; online there doesn't appear to be a way to create shortcuts to favorite radio stations; no scrobbling (there are some 3d party programs for online use). Will continue checking out Pandora, Tunewiki (really like the sync'd lyrics, when it works), Slacker, Winamp, Rdio, etc."

    "reviewText": "Rhapsody is great if you like \"All you can Eat\" music..  There are a lot of music programs and services out there now but I always come back to Rhapsody for a couple reasons.1.) I love their desktop app!!2.) I love being able to use the service with a REAL mp3 player, not just an android phone or ipod touch/iphone.  With the desktop app, the service works with Sandisk MP3 Players (Most are supported but check rhapsody before you purchase one)Now for this app.  The app on android and Kindle is great.  It gives you access, not just to their radio feature, but also to their \"all you can eat\" music service.  You can download the tracks to your phone for free (As long as you keep paying the monthly fee, these songs stay active\".  Their \"radio\" feature is great if you like services like Pandora.  The Rhapsody radio doesn't have the ads like Pandora and other free radio services.  The radio feature is also very smart just like Pandora (Though I would say it is not as smart as Pandora).Overall this is a great app if you like music and like being able to choose what songs you want to listen to or if you wanna listen to an entire album!!  And the app doesn't bog the phone down with adds or video adds like Pandora!Try it for a month!! Most new phones and kindles will give you a free trial! If not you can use this link for one.. I was one over with the free trial I received when I downloaded this app to my Kindle[...]"

I only stay with them because I need to update the license every 30 days or so in order to listen to the music I have downloaded to my MP3 player.  But I am giving serious consideration to going to an alternative music source.  Reason you asked...the software is very &#34;unstable&#34; in my opinion.  It frequently locks up at the most inopportune times.  Obviously, this requires restarting the software program and reloading what I had already begun.  It happens so often, that it has become a pain in the backside.At this point, I would not be strongly recommending Rhapsody to others."

But Rhapsody front ends on the Droid and the PC are sub-par.  The latest app update is better than the previous, but its still butt-ugly, and getting around feels harder than it needs to be.  They've added hi-def streaming to the latest version, and it sounds great.  A track still occassionaly drops, but I'm getting fewer of them now.Someone said that you need a higher priced subscription to use the PC software.  This isn't true, my 9.99/month subscription allows me to use the software on one mobile device and 3 PC's.But as far as the PC software goes, its simply awful.  Its supposed to handle downloads and transfers to your mobile device for offline listening, but I can't get it to work properly with my phone.  Its also hideously ugly (think old school Itunes).  Windows doesn't look like apple, so don't make an app that poorly emulates the look of an app that's already ugly.Great service...just wish they'd write better software, and hire someone who wasn't colorblind to build the interfaces.  Black and blue and gray...no real polish.Easy 5-stars if they bring their interfaces into the modern age, and make the PC version work right.  I've figured out how to download stuff to my phone for offline listening without the PC client, but a functioning client would make this so much more pleasant.They've released a web beta that looks pretty darn sharp--hoping they'll bring its look and feel down to the PC and Android soon and move the button/menu options around so I have less mis-taps."

My eyes have been opened to revelations and deep understanding that otherwise I had been ignorant to. By having and using this app my daily morning study gets me ready for the day and keeps my heart in tune with God.It is customizable to which content I decide to read and listen to. Because of the audio portion my spiritual walk has encountered a new path of what can only be described as an old friend. That is how he will make you feel after just a short listen. I am talking about Pastor McGee and his TTB Bible radio program. It is a five year journey through the entire Bible and no one has been able to explain it as he has.McGee has a unique view into the word of God and looking back he was indeed at the beginning movement of the Christian non denominational faith. He saw the way had been opened and how chains of hierarchy and rules of the old establishment were being abandoned.He is only one of many podcasts that are available, from daily to old sermons to modern convention speeches. Rick Warren has a spot there as well as Joyce Meyers and so many others.Daily reading plans and so many wonderful features.I have gained so much for so long that some time back I became a regular supporter  of their ministry for it is with these works that many are being baptized in the Holy Spirit."

There is quick and easy links to a whole plethora of daily devotionals helping the user to develop their walk with God on a daily basis. I love this app and I have had MANY Bible apps but none can compare to what this one offers."

It's nice that it even has audio because none of the other free bible apps I know of offer that.  My only beef is that sometimes the audio works, and sometimes it doesn't.  I guess it's not the app's fault.  Probably has something to do with the Sprint cellular network I'm on.  I would have preferred to have an option to save the files on my phone as opposed to getting them off the web every time I open it.  That way I'd have instant access to it.  I gave three stars however because despite its problems, the price is right."

    "reviewText": "Overall, a pretty well made tower defense game. I found it to be quite fun, if a bit too easy on the easy settings.Things that aren't in the instructions that people can't seem to figure out on their own:You place power station towers to recharge your towers. 3 were sufficient for me to beat the first level.When placing a tower, you tap the location you want it, and then you can drag your finger around anywhere on the screen to fine-tune the placement. Quite brilliant, that; it solves the problem of trying to carefully place the tower while it's under your thumb.Enemies come from left to right on the first level. I assumed the opposite, due to the background graphic.Overall, a pretty solid game. Runs well, no crashes, no lockups, freezes, or any other negative events. Graphics are suitable to what you would expect from a bubble popping TD game.-1 star for poor instructions, not that it wasn't hard to figure out; very easy, simple game.EVO 3D, FAOTD."

Like others who have it a 1 star review I also like Jelly Defense and Plants vs Zombies; while the graphics may not be as good as those other games, I'm getting much more play time out of this. Jelly Defense took me a while to finish and was worth it (if I had paid for it, another Free App of Day), this one is taking me much much longer to finish.  I'd rather the graphics be lacking if the game can be played for many weeks, or more?I'm addicted to it. I just wish I knew a little more about how certain things work, I'm trying to figure these out. Like I recently learned upgrading the power stations is very important, not just buying more. Upgrade everything.Sometimes I notice a tower right next to a power station let all the things go by without shooting at any of them, I'd like to know what I'm doing wrong when that happens, but that's rare. Also I want to know what it means when a tower has that little power graphic flash or sometimes just stay solid. Does it mean it needs power? Like it wants to shoot but can't at the moment?So other than a wanting a few more instructions, I love the game. Even with the things I can't seem to figure out, it still gets 5 stars.I'm surprised by all the low ratings here and wonder if it's mostly people who dont like or know how to play defense games.I wish people would realize they should rate on the quality of the app, not on whether it's their type of app. The low ratings hurt the developer and cause them to sell less games.If you like defense games get it, if I was suddenly forced to pay for it now, I would definitely buy it, because after a few weeks of playing I have lots of play-time left. Actually, I think I'll end up moving on to a new game before ever finishing all these levels."

The initial towers you can purchase shoot once.  As you earn more coins you can upgrade to better towers, power stations etc.  Anyways, the game looks simple in appearance, but again it's just a simple TD game for your phone.  The two things i don't like were the instructions didn't mention that you can upgrade during waves, not just between waves.  Also, I couldn't slide towers across my screen.  I could only move them by touching the spot on my screen where i'd want them.  This was tedious at times because the tip of your finger isn't as accurate as if you were using a stylus.  Sliding would have been much easier.  HTC Thunderbolt stock."

This app doesn't offer much - it is a clunky game that lacks finesse, especially in level and unit design.The most frustrating part is that the towers are slow. They fire a single shot, and then take forever to reload. And thats plenty of time for a herd of bubbles to go whizzing by. Not much of a defense. It takes a while to figure out that you need to build and upgrade power stations to recharge your towers so they can fire more than once. The instructions aren't too helpful, either. The touchscreen is also laggy at times, which adds to the frustration.It might be easier to just include a button that lets you wave a white flag and surrender, rather than wait patiently for inevitable annihilation.There are many better TD games out there. This one is mediocre, at best."

    "reviewText": "First, it's great news that this app by Maribou does not contain unnecessary permissions, as did another app of theirs a couple of weeks ago.  However, why this developer keeps cranking out game apps that can't be moved to the external SD card remains a mystery and a concern. Yes, it's only a MB in size, and I can fit this app and a whole team of Clydesdale horses in my phone's internals, but for some folks, this will become an issue during app \"spring cleaning,\" and apps like this will be the first to go.Second, wish I would have known the app has no sounds so I didn't have to spend time fiddling with phone settings, thinking it was my settings.Third, with all the same complaints about the power stations over at Google Market, you would think the developers would rethink the app and take them out.  They don't HAVE to -- it's THEIR game.  But if they want to make it OUR game on our devices and charge for it, they would be wise to just redesign it and give the people what they're begging for!  They should take the complaints about the towers for what they really are:  FREE development strategy advice being handed to them on a silver platter!Fourth, the gameplay.  Sadly, it is indeed laggy as many have reported, and coupled with the frustration of the towers, it's just not providing any fun.  If the towers are necessary to provide the energy, they shouldn't be so expensive.  I'm just not sure lowering their price is going to satisfy those who already have developed a distaste for their existence to begin with and, hence, not be the solution to end the complaints.Maribou may want to to take this app back to the drawing board and make these changes... or not.  Depends on whether they want to stay competitive in at least the tower defense market.  And if their ultimate goal is to have customers download multiple apps they create, then for heaven's sake -- let them go to the SD card to attract some non-rooted customers and those who are vigilant as to what they feel is necessary and important enough to take up precious phone space."

The controls aren't perfect though. Placing the towers can be a little cumbersome in terms of fine tuning the location in a hurry. So meaning that after doing the initial click-to-place the &quot;dragging&quot; for fine tuning is very slow. ESC = 'back arrow'.Game plays just fine on my rooted / rom'd Charge."

    "reviewText": "This is a basic tower defense game.It's not the best looking or most advanced, but it is quite functional (at least on the kindle fire).  In my opinion - it could use better descriptions of the towers in the help menu. It's never mentioned that you NEED a power station - or your towers just shoot once...  I think the icon on a tower once it's depleted it's power does a decent job, but that kind of information is critical to gameplay and should be clearly spelled out in the instructions somewhere.I initially went to the help menu because I tried to DRAG my tower to where I wanted to.  It moved amazingly slow.  I figured that COULDN'T be how it was supposed to be.  It wasn't.  The help screen let me know to touch the location where I wanted the tower and then drag it for fine tuning (which actually works well).\"ESC to cancel\" also isn't of much help on the single button kindle fire.  To cancel placing a tower on the kindle fire, hit the little arrow at the bottom of the screen that brings up your menu, then hit the \"back\" arrow.Something else I would REALLY like to see is a \"restart level\" option.  I've placed my towers wrong and I want to go back and do it all again.  I have to exit and save - go back to the main menu, choose the level, select to start fresh.  It would be a lot easier to have menu options to just start over.I like the fact that this game doesn't have crazy permission requirements - but I don't think it's a $2.99 game."

It took me a while to realize that the easiest way to build new towers is NOT to drag them, but click the tower you want to build and then click the place on the map you want to build it.  The game itself gives you strategy tips for the game in general during the 1st level.  The only other thing you need is your brain, and it's a decent tower defense game.  The only thing that could be improved is the graphics, and a forced tutorial level that makes you place certain towers and explains what they do."

It featured 13 different maps and it had a fast forward button to play through each attack at high speed. As long as you plant enough power towers to let your weapons fire you will have it made. You can gain enough points to update the weapons and vastly improve their power for killing the bubbles. The flying balloon weapons are nice as they can track the invaders along the route and continuously bring lethal fire down upon the bubbles. We all know air power rules the battle.I liked how the game did not ask for multiple permissions and finally someone listened to the users and stopped all of the intrusive requests.That being said I have to admit I am not much into tower defense games like this one. I played for quite a while but I just didn't find the game to be as much fun as others I have played. For me this was a 3 star game."

For those of you who can't read or have no common sense: the first little icon shoots one bullet at a time at incoming enemies.  Next icon, (ship wheel looking thing,) shoots out in all directions. Fire icon melts ice balls that will eventually come, or shoots one bullet at regular ones. Blue spiral thing...can't remember. Hot air balloon follows enemies &amp; shoots at them. Finally, the red power icon sets up a power station.While this game may not be goty material, nor is it amazing graphics-wise (they aren't bad, just simple) it's still a good tower defense game. With other higher quality TD games on the market, this one definitely isn't worth $2.99.

Different type towers are needed for different types of baloons traveling the course. Bright colorful graphics show up well on Kindle Fire. There are a dozen or more layouts and about 5 difficulty levels so lots of replay value although I feel the regular price a bit high, in other words I probably wouldn't have paid the price but it's definitely a good app as the free app of the day. Thank you Amazon."

Yes, the graphics are a bit simple, and it isn't the best TD game out there, but it has been a nice addition to the library.  In my opinion, the 1-star reviews are unwarranted, and should be reserved for apps that really should be avoided.As for the permissions, this one really doesn't have any to speak of, so that's definitely a plus!Is it worth $3?  As much as we've enjoyed and played it, I'd say in hindsight yes."

Now, I will give the poor reviews credit, the developer assumes that you have already played the first version of this game, which is why there are few instructions. But seriously people, giving this game 1 star is like a 10 year old saying the original Super Mario Bros for NES was a crap game. It's OLD people, that doesn't make it bad."

That is a poor concept, and without the power station your towers only fire once. The power station &quot;recharges&quot; your towers, but can't handle a lot of them unless you upgrade the station. I gave it a one star for no sound, poor instructions, no real options menu, the use of a &quot;power station&quot; that costs a much as a basic tower and is required, and really for just being a bad game.To the devs, if you are going to force the player to use a power station for the towers either lower the cost or raise the amount of gold players start with."

    "reviewText": "Test device: Samsung Epic, Android 2.2 officialHave problems with locating you car while shopping, at an amusement park, etc?  Car locator *might* be for you.  It's pretty simple to use, and has a ton of extra features tossed in.  Simply tap the little guy in the corner and close the app.  Wen you open it again, it will show you which way you need to go to get back to your car.  Use it to take a pic of your spot and or the cars near you, just in case you need a little extra help or your car is damaged while you're away.  A lot of thought and effort went into Car Locator, and it's a handy little tool.  While obviously it's gear toward automotive use, realistically you can use it to find your way back to any spot you mark.The unhappy truth about this app though is that it relies on GPS location and a digital compass to lead you back.  While you can get away without having the digital compass, you're out of luck without GPS.  This can include times where you're in a spot where GPS signal is weak or non-existent, like a parking garage or around very tall structures.  How accurate Car Locator is is heavily dependent on how good a GPS and GPS signal you have, both at the time you mark your location and when you start trying to find your way back. In my testing, Car Locator was off by as much as 50 feet at times, which may not sound like much, but it's enough to put a good number of cars between you and where you want to be.Overall, I think it's a pretty cool app that will do what it claims if conditions are right."

    "reviewText": "I'm terrible at finding my car in large parking lots. Especially in huge lots like at sports stadiums or concert venues. One place in particular I frequent is an outdoor amphitheater where there are many lots, widely scattered in fields over dozens of acres surrounding the pavilion. So, I downloaded this app and began testing it out. I must say, I'm impressed by the layout, ease of use and many thoughtful features included. I especially like the feature that allows you to text-message the car's location to others in your group. At concerts or sporting events this is a nice feature to have if people get separated from the main group. Of course, this app is not just useful for finding cars - it can be used to remember any given location - say, your hotel when you're traveling in a large, unfamiliar city. I realize Google Maps can handle much of the same functionality but it's nice to have a dedicated app devoted to just one purpose.I've tested this app out and found it to be precise, accurate (to within 9 feet!) and easy to use. The user interface is simple, attractive and logically laid out. Pop-up tips explain everything the app is doing, and provides advice if you need it. It invokes Google Maps for street directions if you wish, and even allows you to take a picture of the surrounding area where the car is parked in order to help you get a better mental fix on your car's location when you're getting close.The built-in timer is a handy way of knowing when it's time to put more quarters in the parking meter. You can set the app to throw a notification when your car has been parked for the length of time that you choose. Tip: If you use this to time parking meters, it might be a good idea to set that timer for a few minutes less than the timer on the parking meter. that gives you enough time to walk back to the meter and feed it more coins. Who knows, it might save you from getting a parking ticket!There are a number of permissions involved with using this app, but they all square with the intended functions of the app, so I don't understand why so many people here are so leery of what permissions are needed.In summary, there is simply no excuse for not being able to find your vehicle if you have this nicely-designed app. This is much better than just using Google Maps, in my opinion."

All of that said, remembering where the car is isn't my favorite feature.

    "reviewText": "Definitely not worth it since it only locates the car 60-70% of the time. Sometimes it is spot on but other times it is WAY OFF.Originally installed this on my Optimus S about a year ago but it didn't always find the car, and it was a HUGE battery hog, so I uninstalled it back then.I thought maybe the app has been updated in past year and the problems would be fixed, so I downloaded the newest version and tried it again. Still the same problems. The app is constantly running in the background and seriously drains the battery. It runs in the background even after rebooting the phone, and restarts itself even after being force closed. Obviously the dev doesn't care since it's been just over a year and a lot of people are still complaining about the same things they were 1 year ago.Great idea but poorly executed. Pity, I really hoped the app would have worked right after all this time."

    "reviewText": "I was pleasantly surprised on the value and functionality of this free app.  I have over-the-air antenna TV in the Los Angeles area and receive 120 stations.  This app found them all when I provided my zip code.  It permits easy 'filtering' to delete those that are of no interest.  After deleting ones of no interest, it lists all the remaining (in my case 23) in increasing numerical order.  For each channel in this window it gives three listings, what's currently on, and the next two listings.  What I found wonderfully valuable, when a channel from this list is clicked-on, it opens another window that shows all the listings for that one channel for the rest of the day, and even into the next day, along with a detail description of each listing.  It also allows one to scroll back in time to see what was on earlier, so one can see if a desired show has been missed.My Samsung 46\" HDTV has a nice TV listing capability, but this 'TV' app is even better.A few additional comments (room for improvement):- when in the detailed listings window for one channel, clicking on the back arrow on the Kindle-Fire returns one to the 'main' TV window.- the search feature, which is accessed via the magnifying glass icon on the Kindle Fire menu bar, only searches current programs.- there is no 'help' or instruction page, but except for a few items like the above, most are self-event.02/08/14 UPDATE:Since the `upgrade' of the `TV Listing' app in December 2013 the channel filtering capability has become unreliable, making this app far less user friendly than it was prior.  As such I've downgraded my rating to 3 stars.While many channels can be successfully filtered-out (in my case 120), they typically reappear after one or two additional uses of the app; that is, exiting the app and returning to it at a later time.I've come to learn that the created filter is not lost, but is simply not being applied.  A total reboot of my Kindle Fire tablet does, in fact, result in the filter being applied without having to recreate it.  However, rebooting the KF is time-consuming, and otherwise of no value (The KF sleeps beautifully with no noticeable battery drain, and it wakes from sleep much, much faster than the time it takes to reboot it.)We user's will of course be very grateful when the channel filtering capability is returned to its former reliability.The TV app is otherwise a great app.  When, and if, the channel filtering is returned to its prior functionality I will again update this review and upgrade my star rating.04/27/14 UPDATE:As of the April 2014 upgrade of `TV Listing', the channel filtering capability now works perfectly.  Along with other improvements such as the capability to separately list movies, sports, documentaries, etc. for not only the current day, but also for any day in the following week, this app is outstanding.  It now also has a search capability to find a specific desired showing, as well the ability to set an Alert in advance of a desired presentation (my Kindle Fire gives off a loud buzz).  This app now easily deserves a full 5 star rating, and then some!"

I can choose the time of day I want to watch, I can read a synopsis of the programs, and set reminders for the shows I want to see.  I don't have to log in (otherwise I'd probably have just used the listings by my cable provider).  I can also remove the channels I don't watch.  That means if I'm watching to just relax I don't have to look at any of the news channels, financial channels, sales channels, or programs in languages that I don't understand.  This is really convenient and useful.  And best of all FREE!!!"

Ditto for movies.Viewing the entire line-up for one channel each day is so easy and quick.My only complaint is that I can't save my home viewing area and set up a new one I go on vacation in another viewing area."

I tried this one because sometimes iTV is glitchy and I wondered if I could find a more reliable app but even if this one is more reliable, the difference in display wasn't worth it for me.Amendment: After further problems with other apps, I've gone back to this one. It's more reliable and has not once caused a problem on my Nexus 7. You can move ahead to look at the times or look at the schedule for an individual channel."

You can configure your TV provider and select the channels that you want to see.  The only real issue I've had ongoing is that it occasionally adds additional channels that I am not interested in and I have to remove them, but I can do this from the main screen, so it isn't a big deal.Recently (the past couple of months), however, it keeps losing the configuration info.  It still knows my provider, but the channels I am not interested are no longer excluded.  There are over 700 channels with my TV provider and while most that I am interested in are at the beginning of the list, there are some that are not and it is a pain to scroll to find them.  It takes a couple of minutes to reconfigure.  There are options in the configuration screen for &#34;select all&#34; and &#34;deselect all&#34;, which is great because with so many channels, I can deselect and then simply select the ones I want, but the fact that I recently have to keep doing this is a deal-breaker.I waited to post such a review because I wanted to give the developer a chance to correct, but apparently they are either unaware of the problem or uninterested in fixing it.  In the meantime, I will be looking for a new tool to get my TV listings.I am running on a Kindle Fire HD."

    "reviewText": "We have Comcast, and when it comes to the \"premium\" (a matter of opinion) channels, they only list one each for HBO, Strz, etc. high definition channels. For programs in Hi Def, you have to go to \"On Demand\" for each of the premium channels.That may not make sense to you, but there isn't much sense about 900 channels to begin with. And that's where TV Listings for Android comes in. I downloaded it to my Kindle Fire, and up popped 900 programs for every half-hour on almost every channel we get. And THAT was great except that I don't ever watch 830 of those channels.In order to \"delete\" the channels that you don't watch, you have to check them off and delete them one at a time. This would rate 5 stars plus if there was a way to block, say channel 300 through 699 and delete them. After that, there's another group of 200 channels, and then I wouldn't mind picking out individual channels.Right now, even after some selection, when I want to see what's on at 9 PM, I'll get a list of 400 programs.Now, if that app would like to go a step further, I'd like to be able to delete individual programs that I will never watch ... like Tivo."

It's like when we were kids....good sitcoms in evenings, family stuff in afternoons, kids stuff after school and cartoons on Saturdays, and garbage during the daytime except on one channel which runs stuff like Mr. Ed, I Dream of Jeannie, and McHale's Navy....real fun shows! This app helps us to see what's on. It's easy to browse since we don't have many stations. I set some timers for tomorrow to see how those work. I don't mind the ads as long as they don't flash ...developers need to get  paid for their service. More categories would be nice...Westerns please!"

For further control, you can filter only the channels you want to see listed and move to any time of day you wish. I use this quite regularly, it is way quicker than watching the TV Guide channel and this app is far superior to the TV Guide official app (which is pretty bloated).UPDATE December 2 2013: The latest version of this app is severely crippled by a bug. You can filter out channels that you don't want to see in the listings, but the app forgets the channels you have filtered every time you launch it. To me, this severely decreases the usefulness of the app. I'll be looking for an alternative."

    "reviewText": "I love this app.I am one of those people that has just about everything technology wise that you can think of...but for whatever reason, I DESPISE using the guides onscreen on my television to see what is on.I did that, because of lack of options, but I longed for a subscription to TV Guide.  However, the newest versions of TV Guide leave a lot to be desired, in my opinion.Along comes this App which I stumbled across purely by accident...but it's absolutely stellar.It's like having a virtual TV Guide on my tablet and my phone.  I especially like that I can filter out channels that I'm not interested in.  I have filtered out all of the shopping networks and several of the news networks, along with all of the country music channels and ALL of the \"Music playing on a blank screen\" channels.The search feature works great, and the other major feature that I truly love is the fact that you can quickly select \"Movies, Sports, or What's On\" right from the main menu.  That way you can quickly search for those several different types of items.I am giving this App five stars, but there are a few improvements that I would LOVE to see.  More auto filters would be great...such as \"Comedy, Drama, Documentary, etc.\"  I would LOVE to be able to hit \"Drama\" and see which episodes of \"Law and Order\" are on at any given time.Overall, however, this is an awesome app and I'm REALLY glad I stumbled on it.I would gladly pay a few dollars for the App if there were a paid version.  Highly recommended."

    "summary": "Basic",
    "reviewText": "I got this app to replace BuddyTV, which I liked better, but had some problems with. The best feature of this app is speed, but the navigation could be better - see below for more details.PROS: The interface is simple and uncluttered, and it's very fast. Setup is pretty intuitive. You can set reminders within the program, or use the Share with Friends feature to send it to your notes or reminders apps (which it detects automatically). The Share option also detects email and messaging apps, not just social media accounts (I don't have any set up, so I don't know whether it detects those, but the auto-detect seems strong, so I imagine it does. But it won't prompt you to log in to social media accounts you don't have or want like many apps do).CONS: Rather than a grid, it shows the next 3 shows for the selected time in list view for each channel, which is not ideal for planning an evening of viewing. The link to change the time is tiny, and hard to open without tapping the channel below it instead. Scrolling is oversensitive, so it's tough to get it to a specific channel without going past it. A giant ad fills the second screen as you scroll down, which makes it especially difficult to scroll to the channels right above and below the ad (which happen to be the ones I watch most). You can set favorite channels, but after it's been running in the background for awhile, it forgets them. There is no favorites button to bring them back, and refreshing doesn't help. You have to go back to your home screen and reclick the icon, sometimes 2-3 times to get it to show your favorites again. The reminder times are preset, with no custom option (so it will remind 5 or 15 minutes before program, but not 10). This is a minor issue, with an easy workaround, however - as mentioned in Pros, it auto-detects your reminder and notes apps through the Share with a Friend function, so you can swiftly export to another app with customizable time settings.CONCLUSION: All-in-all, this app is just OK, although it is faster and simpler than most. A few navigation tweaks (larger and better separated time changing button, smaller ads, slower scroll) and fixing the favorites caching problem could build on that to give it a major leg up over the crowd, but as it is now, I'm ready to jump ship if I find anything better."

Even when clicking on the ad and going to its website, it remains when returning to TV Listings.A previously great app is now essentially useless and beyond frustrating when you want to quickly see what's on television right now. All because of the developer's greed and complete lack of concern for its customers.This app currently has an average rating of 4 stars, which was well deserved before. It has no longer earned the right to be rewarded with a high rating nor to have customers show their support by downloading it.Until the developer has a change of heart, I urge everyone to refrain from downloading this useless program and that all past reviewers change their rating to one star... since, unfortunately, it is no longer a 5-star app."

    "reviewText": "I've bee using this app for 2-3 years and was happy with it until the so called upgrade. This new version, while glitzier, is buggy. Sometimes works, sometimes won't connect to my network. Also the previous version allowed you see TV schedules several days into the future; I can't find how to do that now and the channel filtering is more laborious. I'm giving 3 stars because when it works it's okay but as it is it's way too undependable in this new iteration. If all the kinks are worked out I'll edit this review. However, since the old version worked so well why can't they just 'downgrade' back to it (or 'upgrade' back to the old version)?To top it all off I tried the 'Contact Us' button. It asked for my email address as was expected. What was not expected was asking for my email password - wtf!!! To say the least I aborted my attempt at contact. Seemed like an attempt at phishing or ID theft to me.4-7-14 UPDATE: I found the feature that allows you to see future schedules but only for one particular channel at a time. In order to see future schedules you must tap on each individual channel. Again, cumbersome and laborious. Also when I opened the program today I found all OTA channels listed - not filtered for my channels. Oh boy, how long is it going to take to get it right??!!! Have downgraded to two stars."

I tried removing it and then reinstalling it, and now I get that the app is not reading the internet.  THIS IS WHY I DON'T UPGRADE APPS.!!!!!!!!24 HOURS LATER 4-5-14 THE APP IS BACK.!!  THANK YOU!  Now it offers 7 days of programming, category selection, and better information  on your selected programs.Because of the advertising window, which is still annoying, I NOW GIVE THIS APP 4 STARS.!!  Check it out, again.IT IS MY OPINION,since this app has a new logo,a new name and new features,it should also have new reviewing stats. Which is looking like (2) 4 stars vs (12+) 1 star.My suggestion is delete this app 100% (device,cloud,and app library) wait a day and then reinstall. That's what I did."

Thus I found this app for my Kindle Fire TV Listings for Android which enables me to check the local cable channel guide while I am viewing my TV.

The music on this channel is also SO annoying, so I really wanted to find a way that I could just quickly look through the channels to find something good. I found a website that worked okay (titanTV) but many of the channel numbers or programs were often incorrect. I got this app just on the off chance that it would work better, and it DOES! It's so easy to use, and (thus far) everything it's said has been right. Fabulous app; a must for any avid TV watcher."

Once selected, you'll see every channel available and what is on now and the next two programs to come along with their respective times. Select the channel and it'll take you to a screen that shows you what programs will play throughout the day and each with detailed episode description. Now you'll know whether your favorite show is a rerun or worth recording it on TiVo&reg;.

I have 100 csble channels and am lucky to find one thing worth watching within a 24 hour period. This app gives you the best possible chance of finding that one episode. My only suggestion would be to add ratings to help search for new favorites - something we all value infinitely on Amazon.  That was, everytime they cancel the only show that doesn't suck (e.g. Prime Suspect, Lie to Me, Medium, etc.) t will be helpful in watching for a new replacement."

Sweet!  Or so I thought. That was yesterday. This evening, I opened the app again, and found only one obscure station listed, not even one we get. And it refused to populate with the actual channels we get, even with re-searching and re-setting. Couldn't get it to do anything except show one oddball channel.On my Asus EEE Transformer TF101: Same experience, very good performance yesterday, and then crash-and-burn tonight.Needless to say I've uninstalled it from both devices. It's very disappointing! This app did just what I wanted, when it worked. Too bad, so sad.So far, an app called i.TV seems to be doing better. But then, I just installed that one tonight. Who knows what it will do tomorrow?"

This isn't a huge deal but I mostly like to use this app to confirm a showing I'm seeing later.I like the summaries. But I don't like they only show one at a time. You click on the channel and it shows one summary. For the next one, you have to load into a new page.I tried both orientations (portrait and landscape) to see if it's any different and it's not.Also the massive ad in the middle is pretty annoying.

    "reviewText": "This was a first for me... TV Listings by Jersey completely drained my battery.I was so disappointed with TV Listings that I compared it to TV Guide.  In fairness, this isn't in-depth; there may be non-intuitive ways to do things I couldn't quickly find.Configuration:TV Listings takes longer than TV Guide to start-up.TV Listings and TV Guide both have providers.  Neither has packages, so if you have, e.g., Dish HD with ~150 channels, you still have 1200+ listedYou can reduce those visible by setting \"Favorites\" in TV Guide or \"Filter\" in TV Listings.  This is easier in TV Listings; they're on one screen with checkboxes, like the Dish Network \"Favorites\" screen.  In TV Guide, it seems you have to click on each channel from the listing page and then add it to your Favorites, which is much much slower.Search:TV Listings has a terrible search.  It's slow but works, but only shows results for the current-grid half-hour.  So if you search for \"Charmed\" (which is in heavy rotation these days), you don't get ANY displayed results if it isn't on NOW.  You can hit \"+\" or \"-\" to switch time slots, but that takes another 25 seconds and you have to repeat and repeat and repeat to find if it's showing today.  So if you want to find out when \"Training Your Dragon\" is playing, you're out of luck.TV Guide search works as you would expect.  Results are listed by day, all retrieved at once, and easy to scroll through.  And you can organize by Date, alphabetically by Title (though since you still have to expand the letter-groups, that's of limited apparent value), and Genre (e.g. Movie, Lifestyle, Childrens.)  And it's faster.Device Support:TV Listings completely ignores Landscape mode.  Even with the physical keyboard open, it's Landscape.  TV Guide supports Landscape somewhat; things rotate (easier to type in searches), but the ribbon bar with \"Search\", \"Favorites\", etc. is blank.Neither program allows you to scroll to the next timeslot with a finger-swipe.TV Listings U.I. Notes:My biggest gripe with TV Listings is that every action incurs a delay.The Listing screen is nice; it shows the current and next few shows for each channel.  On my device, that's four channels per screen.  Clicking on the channel shows the listing for that channel.\"Return\" does what I would expect in TV Listings.TV Guide U.I. Notes:My biggest gripe with the TV Guide U.I. is that the \"return\" button, which should go to the previous screen, instead tries to exit the app.The Listing screen shows the current show... what you are probably used to seeing.  Five per screen on my device, with space also taken by a large ribbon (\"TV Listings\", \"Favorites\", \"Search\", \"News\"), by the nave list and by a blank space that may typically be used for advertising.  (Most ad servers are blocked on my phone.)To see every show on a channel, click on the channel icon on the Listings page and choose a day.Summary: This is an odd situation where you can't go RIGHT with either choice.  TV Listings has a terrible search-results presentation and dreadful lag, and killed my battery.  TV Guide has lag I would have considered dreadful if not for TV Listings being worse, an abysmal filter/favorites configuration and bad choice of how to use the \"return\" key.  But I find the TV Guide search facility far more useful than the TV Listings one, because being able to easily search across times is the really important part of \"search\".Update 20 April 2012: A year later, I tried it again.  And still the same flaws.  Even on the Kindle Fire.  Default providers - 1300 or so channels for Dish.  You must deselect or select manually; it can't even distinguish between HD and standard def, so by default you get two copies of many channels.  And the Search is still only for the specifically selected time... you can't find a movie or when the show will next be on, just what's on now.Which means that not only was this weak a year ago, but it hasn't improved.  Huh."

Each time I 'cheat' I learn more about methods to achieve a full correct grid.I didn't know until today that there was a paid version. I have been playing the free version all along. For all my enjoyment I bought the paid version and am still as happy with the results. There is no better game out there! I've tried! Maybe someday I will be able to call myself a Sudoku Master! ;)"

I'll never overcome the problem but I hope to patch it up a bit.  This app has been a terrific aid in learning the Sudoku puzzles and although I still make a lot of mistakes I believe the game and this app have helped me.  BUT there is an annoying rating (or grading) page at the end of the puzzles that pops up and reminds me that some super duper whizz bang player/s completed the same puzzle in seven to ten percent of the time it took me and that sometimes dozens of others completed it in less than twenty percent of my time.  In my view Sudoku is like golf where the player's biggest opponent is the player him/her self.  A golfer completes a round and finishes first in a foursome only to have someone in the clubhouse announce \"that score stinks compared to the top finishers at \"The Masters\".  I realize this reads like sour grapes from a looser but like golf and other competitions the players take to the same fields of competition but the super players are only ranked against those of equal skill and talent.Other wise I rate this full five star app."

    "reviewText": "I have used at least a half dozen sudoku apps (and even enjoyed some enough to give positive reviews). I tried the free version of this one first and was so impressed that I bought the paid version just because I believe the developer has earned it. The layout works well and you can customize the interface to work the way YOU want. That is nice. What sets this apart is the hint system. It's not about solving the puzzle you are working on, but learning HOW to solve so you can do it yourself in the future. When I first started using the app I was working (and struggling) at the Intricate difficulty level (there are 13 levels of difficulty - Intricate is 7th). Now I'm regularly working at Annoying (9th) and can make serious attempts at Devious (10) and Fiendish (11). I subscribe to the saying \"Give a man a fish, he eats for a day, teach a man to fish and he eats for a lifetime.\" This app teaches you how to complete puzzles using the most advanced logic. Very highly recommended!"

Usually it is the opposite.  When you choose the number all the spots you've already chosen that number light up, making it easy to see if you are making a mistake or not.So, full marks for having something that is fun and challenging, giving a lot of options, and properly using all of the screen real estate to the best of its potential.  If you love Sudoku you HAVE to purchase this app."

    "reviewText": "Definitely grab this today if you have any interest in a sudoku app. There's plenty of them around, some that are free. But this one is by far the best i've used. I can't say that it's worth $3 for everyone, as i'm not personally a hardcore sudoku guy. But really, the tutorials really make this worth it. The hard puzzles are actually challenging. Theres no shortage of puzzles. The highlighting system rocks, as well as the best hinting system i've seen..I need a lot of hints ^_^ so I very much appreciate the attention to detail there. The main menu doesn't look like anything special, but the actual board is clean and clear. Nice job, and definitely worth the money for people who love sudoku. Enjoy!Phone: Droid X(Android 2.2.1, Liberty 2.0.1)"

    "reviewText": "I play sudoku in a magazine and on my Kindle. 2 previous games were more tedious to use. One occassionally fouled up so that I couldn't even finish the game. This one has 2-3 options for how to use the pencil mark and guess for a square. It also has several helps, which I have an option to use or not at my preference. I do like the option for the software to tell me if there are errors and then if I want them fixed, I tell it to fix, but I don't have to. I also like that when I am working on 7's (for example) all of the sevens on the board are highlighted and all of the 7 pencil marks are also highlighted. This adds another level of testing for accuracy and guessing."

There is a very good tutorial included.  I have only played the free game so far, but I am going to buy the paid version right now!! You should get this if you want to learn how to play the correct way, instead of guessing sometimes.  It is also pretty easy to understand. I have tried many of the Sudoku games out there, but this is by far the best!!!"

    "reviewText": "I've tried five or six sudoku apps, with varying degrees of satisfaction. I review here Enjoy Sudoku (ES) for the KF.Enjoy Sudoku is one of the best board-type game applications I've ever seen, across all forms of games, across several platforms.The display is beautiful. I typically play with my KF in portrait position. I've tried landscape; it works perfectly, but it's just not to my taste. The highlighting of completed row/box is useful. Highlighting \"all number N used\" is extremely helpful, but having the display flash in different colors takes a bit of getting used to.The user controls are OK:- Entering choices using the box-first approach is intuitive. Entering number-first-then-box is claimed to be faster, but again, it takes some getting used to. (Because of the highlighting feature, I've not been able to get used to it because of the way the colors change back and forth.)- The undo/back-track command is really great. I haven't yet found how deep the undo stack is, but I've exercised it pretty well, I think.- I've used the rotate/mirror commands only once, but the change of viewpoint enabled me to finish a \"fiendish\" (toughest level) puzzle. Bravo.- I have yet to figure out what other command buttons do - from my perspective, ES behaves just a tad strangely when some buttons are pressed. I suppose I should read the manual, but a perfect app is written so all controls are intuitive.A truly strong point of ES is the range of available daily games: there are FOURTEEN levels, ranging from trivial to, well, really really (near impossibly) hard. Winner, winner, chicken dinner. There is a slight discontinuity in difficulty: the game takes a big jump somewhere around \"moderate\" or \"intricate.\" I can live with that. Starting over doesn't impact time-to-complete scoring (I'm divided on this one).At the end of a game, you get some feedback with a rough percentile chart. Sorta informative. It would be nicer if there was an absolute ranking; \"User_name is 483 of 10 zillion\" could be rewarding to players.I really recommend this app to KF owners."

Not because it's perfect - the resolution on my XOOM could be higher and the game is not as responsive to tilting the tablet as it should be - but because I just love playing it. It's got a definite retro, arcade feeling and, unlike something that you could have played back in the late 80's/early 90's, it responds to your gadget's accelerometer. And, with unlimited ammo, missiles and lots more surprises, it's just plain, no apologies fun.I got mine as the free Amazon 'app of the day' but it's worth the admission price from anyone looking for a simple but fun arcade game.P.S. - the game allows for 'keyboard' controls and I was in fact able to play it off a bluetooth keyboard paired with my tablet but why would anyone want to do that? It's easier to score because you're a lot more accurate but it's not as much fun as the tilting or accelerometer mode."

    "summary": "Eye candy?",
    "reviewText": "Test devices:Samsung Epic, Android 2.2 officialViewsonic gTablet, Calkulin+Clemsyn 1.5ghz Froyo Combo V6There are tons of side scrolling shooters out there, and Overkill is just one of them.  Boasting superior graphics and sound always attracts my attention, so I snatched up this title as soon as I could.On my little Epic, I was able to kick in all the eye candy Overkill offered and still maintain over 50 frames per second.  Everything was very smooth, not a single glitch or hiccup.  I even enabled the fast load option and didn't encounter an issue.  Everything was nicely detailed and crystal clear.  Very, very nice.  On the gTablet, things didn't fare so well.  Averaging 45 frames per second, everything did work, and worked just as smoothly as it did on the Epic, but the graphics were *so* not superior.  They are all fuzzy and lacking detail.  I toggled every option in every combination possible and still they barely entered medicore range. Sorry guys, try again.  As for the sound, yeah, it's pretty good.  Clear sound effects and a good background soundtrack.On both my devices, the accelerometer control was dead on perfect.  I like that Overkill recalibrates at the beginning of each level, adjusting itself to how you're holding the device at the time.  This allows you to to play the game in pretty much any position you want.  In game recalibration is also there, to give you a chance to fix things up if they aren't to your liking.  Doing some good thinking, Overkill's dev also put in sensitivity adjustment, which will allow the game to be adjusted to the device and gamer's preferred style of play.  Keyboard/touchscreen controls worked just as well, with nary a missed movement or sluggish response.  Sorry, I don't own a Zeemote, so I was unable to test this function.The game itself is what I would consider a complete title.  Besides running through a storylined campaign mode, there is is a test mode, quick mission mode, and survival mode, all of which extend the replay level.  Multiple difficulty levels can be played, with the difficulty level factored into your score.  The computer AI's lines are only slightly cheesy, and often humorous.  As is typical with games of this genre, weapons upgrades are available and new weapon types appear at different parts of the games.  A complete help section is built in, with links back to the dev's site for yet more information.  Gameplay is action packed, with no laggy spots.  The one thing I don't particularly care for, besides the less than stellar graphics on the tablet, is the use of the screen real estate.  In general, I think all the objects are too big, giving the gameplay a cramped feeling.With all that praise, why only three stars?  Simple - if you're going to make a lot of hoopla about the graphics and don't deliver, that's a double negative for me.  Get that fixed up, and it's a 4-5 star title.I hope you found this review helpful, and if not, feel free to leave comments/question"

And at the end of the day, those at not words to describe a game that will keep me coming back for more. Which is sad, because it has everything else going for it."

It reminds me of some classic arcade games (can't think of their names off the top of my head) and has some cool modern elements to it.  It is challenging, and not just because the controls are tough.  It takes a little while to figure out what is going on in the game, but the learning curve isn't too steep.  They give you three control options.  First is tiling the screen to use the accelerometer to control the ship.  This is extremely difficult, though novel, and might be a good way to do it if you're used to it.  The second way is by using the touchscreen, which is a little finicky, and can be challenging when your fingers are in the way of your view, but they worked the best for me.  The third is to use some sort of controller (Wii-mote maybe?) which would probably be ideal, but I haven't gotten around to trying that yet.  I knocked a point off for the controls, otherwise would be perfect to me.  Plays well on my Motorola Atrix."

    "summary": "Pretty fun game reminds me of old school Defender",
    "reviewText": "Reviewed on HTC Thunderbolt & Asus TransformerNice game decent graphics in the 2d side shooter genre, think old school Defender with a few differences.On the Thunderbolt, I found the controls to be resposive and the gameplay smooth and challenging. Decent graphics, several game modes, and challenging gameplay make for a fun game.I noticed in the description it said it was redesigned to support tablets, so I expected HD graphics or improved controls or something, I did not see any optimization on my Transformer running Honeycomb 3.2, the 3.2 software sizes the game to fill the screen resulting in less resolution and stretched graphics for apps that aren't optimized for tablets. This appeared to be the case with this game.So the look wasn't optimized, next to check controls.Upon attempting to play the game using the acceleometer, I found that it was wanting me to control it as though it were in portrait mode but was in landscape, thereby making it unplayable using that method. Next I used screen control method with better results but found the controls using this method difficult although playable on a 10.1 inch screen. So, unless I'm missing another tablet version of this game, it definitely isn't optimized and is barely playable at least on Asus Transformers. As it is only \"redesigned to support\" tablets and only optimized for the Galaxy  Tab (really, why only that one?), I guess I couldn't expect too much, but most games are playable with 3.2, I don't know how the controls could get messed up so much, but I digress.So bottom line, this was great on my Thunderbolt, ran perfectly, but for a supposedly \"tablet supported\" game it failed badly on my Transformer, so if that's all you have to use apps on, I'd skip this for now.Anyhow, as long as you aren't buying this for your Transformer it's a good game, at $2 it's higher than most, and I'm not sure I'd pay more than a buck, but it is a good game overall and if you like Defender type games you'll like this.Feel free to comment but know that Amazon will not allow me to reply. Long story, but basically, if I were you I wouldn't reply to any of the troll reviews or correct others misconceptions, Amazon will ban you for criticising others reviews. Its a lifetime ban so there you go."

    "reviewText": "This app I would have definitely rated 5 stars if not for the inability to move it to the SD card or keep an internal score.  This app has almost no permissions, which is GREAT.  So what reason it has to be stationed on the internal storage is a mystery.  It's not a critical utility app that may require it to load on the boot, nor does it contain a widget.... so WHY?  Why ruin an otherwise very decent, low-permissions app with that horrible oversight?  And I'm very happy to not see social networking components like Feint in the app, but is there any good reason not to at least keep internal scoring and add a permission to write to the SD for that purpose?  I'm shaking my head on why this developer wouldn't do these two simple things to make the app more valuable.  The gameplay was great.  I had no problems with boredom and the like.  I don't need to be entertained by little birds perched on wire that fly away when you select a letter.  This app is clearly for adults looking for content rather than primarily \"graphic bling.\"  One other suggestion:  Lose the italics.  Word game people who like to play for extended periods of time of more than 10 minutes will begin to find the italic print irritating and not as easy for the eyes to adjust to.If the italics are removed, internal scoring is added, and it gets moved to the external SD, I'll be back to happily change this rating to a 5-star one.  Til then, I have to chalk its tire and tell it to move along, with a 1-star citation for parking itself on my phone's No Parking Zone."

I think it would be even more fun if you could have the added challenge of an opponent.  Maybe they will add that option to the game, but in the meantime it is worth a try if you are at all fond of word-related games.  A very good FAOTD choice."

As each bubble is hit (with a satisfying POP!) it grows a size until finally it bursts, sending a blast to the nearest horizontal and vertical bubbles, which in turn causes them to grow. You are given a limited number hits, but as the bubbles burst they will do some of the popping for you.The trick is to figure out which bubbles to hit to cause a chain reaction of bubble popping splendor!A good time waster. You can solve bubble grid puzzles or play arcade mode to either get a high score or just to zone out on the pop pop popping.Minus one star simply because it can get dull doing nearly the same thing over and over, with no new challenges or rewards in higher levels."

Despite it's white-on-white upper case 'T' icon that's difficult to see here, it's a worthy consideration when you need to take a word search a bit deeper.Granted that the Kindle Fire devices have a decent way to check the spelling for the words that you may enter, in its native form you have no way of looking for that similar, alternative word that might fit your needs a bit better. As a reference work for basic needs in grouping words together according to similarity of meaning, and containing synonyms and often antonyms, this is an app that works well.At less than 180KB, it's a fast download, and once installed, you'll find its interface easy to use and quite intuitive. It also keeps a history of the words that you've looked up.TheThesaurusapp for the original Kindle Fire or the Kindle Fire HD series is recommended for wordsmiths of all ages, and the price is quite reasonable for all it does.10/16/2012; Updated 1/5/2013"

It is hard enough to exercise your brain, but not so difficult that you have spend hours on each game.  (My best time is 4 minutes and my average time is 11 minutes, so this is a game that you can play while waiting a few minutes for a dr. appt, or while a passenger in a car.)  If you don't exit out of the game, your game in progress will still be there the next time you open it.  I just press the button that brings me back to my phone's home page if I need to stop the game and do something else and then the game is waiting for me the next time I open the game.  I also have the free solitaire and free cell games from Odesys.  I like them too and they also have a setting for playing only solvable games."

    "reviewText": "Maybe but I'm not convinced. I happen to like Honeycomb's standard interface more than dxTop's but that's a matter of taste. Objectively, the scope of this app - take near-complete control of my desktop (and yes, it comes with custom icons and themes) - was enough of a concern for me to remove it shortly after installation. I asked myself how other, more modest add-ons would perform while dxTop was in charge and I find the answer quickly. \"Application Folder Pro\", my favorite folder organizer was unusable under the new management. Others apps and widgets may be preempted but that's as far as my investigation went.If accepted as the alternative interface, the app is deep and complex enough to demand quite a substantial time investment but that would be okay if the rewards justified the effort. In my case (XOOM, Honeycomb) they don't. I wasn't able to justify allowing a \"vendor's\" app to make phone calls on my behalf without me knowing it, just to mention one of the more intrusive rights you grant the app as you install it. And, on a more parochial note, dxTop was stuck in 'portrait' on my XOOM. There may be some setup option that might change that to 'auto-rotate' but I removed dxTop before I found it.For 'positives', this does appear to be a well-thought, well-designed overlay but it's a radical departure from Android's way of interacting with the end-user so one of the first questions that popped into my mind was: if they believe that Android's interface deserves to be so completely wiped out, why not produce their own mobile OS? Seriously.In the Android world what I need and in fact I welcome at this time is 'helpers' such as 'App Folder Pro', not a new boss. dxTop tries to make itself the boss and I have not use for that."

But I always download because I want to be ready to pounce. Even despite the reviews I was like, &quot;Huh, maybe it will still work.&quot;  My dissapointment set in when I went to install it and the permissions were far more reaching than the capabilities of not only the descriptions but the reviews.This app wants to read my messages? It wants to read my system log? Why? It wants unintrusive access to everything on my phone which, if it's replacing the Droid OS, I understand BUT when I look at the reviews and the full capabilities of the app it makes me extremely nervous. It's just this side of jailbreaking my phone as it is, no reason to invite trouble where it isn't needed."

    "reviewText": "Yesterday (or the day before) the free app of the day was something to organize apps into folders, with added functionality.  That app was rated well, as there is, arguably, a use for it and the app was intuitive and ran well.  This app replaces something that doesn't need replacing.  Whether you run Froyo or Gingerbread, either will be faster and smoother than this offering.  I can see limited appeal for those who feel the need to customize and tweak and recustomize their devices, but I have better things to do with my time than &quot;fix&quot; what isn't broken and replace it with something that isn't quite as good."

    "reviewText": "Test devices:Samsung Epic, Android 2.2 officialViewsonic gTablet, Calkulin+Clemsyn 1.5ghz Froyo Combo V6Oh, another launcher replacement!  Love these, and customizing was the whole reason for leaving the iPhone behind.  I've tried out lots of them, ADW, Launcher Pro, VTL, and more, settling in on Go Launcher EX for my phone and tablet. Along comes dxTop Pro, and I'm ready to give it a go.Comparing against my previous experience, dxTop Pro isn't too shabby.  It has lots of customization built in, including an iPhone-like lock screen replacement.  There are a fair number of themes for it, but many will cost you and there aren't nearly as many as there are for other launchers.  On both devices, the performance felt laggy, not as snappy as what I'm used to.  Flipping between screens rapidly, say from all the way left to all the way right, invariably stalled and required a second swipe to get to the last screen.  Looking that the resources being used, dxTop Pro eats up a good bit more than Go Launcher EX (22-30MB vs 17-21MB). The included screen capture is a nice idea, but had a tendency to stick and shoot multiple shots.  The captured images didn't include the wallpaper, which is a bummer.  Sadly, the screen capture only worked outside of applications.  The folder setup is depreciated from stock, in that you have to manually put items into the folders one at a time.  On the plus side, you can change the folder icon to whatever you like, including photos.To sum it all up, dxTop has a bunch of cool little features but they come at a price.  Perhaps as it matures it will get better. I'll hang onto it for a bit but have a feeling I'll be back to Go Launcher EX within a week or two.I hope you found this review helpful, and if not, feel free to leave comments/questions"

The biggest thing that irked me as that it replaced how I turn on my phone (the launch screen, is it called?). It completely replaced it and didn't ask me if it was okay first. Worst yet, I dug around the options and could not figure out how to turn my old screen back on. It was about this time that I gave up on it. Otherwise, I mostly liked what I saw and liked that it offered a lot of options (just not the one I wanted).Worth considering, especially today while it is free, but it wasn't up to LauncherPro status to me."

By default it isn't the most beautiful, but you can customize it to death.What I do like:- apps sorted alphabetically in a clear fashion- lots of themes- 5 way switching between homescreens,  would work nice with 5 screensWhat I don't care about:- the recent apps drawer with services and running apps- 5 homescreen. I don't need so many. So it kind of makes the 5 way switching useless- a gazillion themes.  It should look great by defaultWhat I dislike:- it's a lot more sluggish than go launcher ex or the default touching on my phone- themes are pricey. I don't want to pay more for a theme than for the app.- it looks low-def on my screen. And the ui has many inconsistent quality things.- lack of included widgets,  go launcher has great widgets"

My advice, ignore the bad reviews and try it yourself. It's free for f's sake!And to the reviewer below me, no, this app did not break your phone. If you believe that is even possible you need to immediately post your EVO on craigslist and go buy an iPhone."

    "reviewText": "Got this for free, just gave it a few days to try out the features before reviewing. The description touts the diamond pattern layout of the windows, and that is the greatest thing this app brings to the table, which I have not seen in any other launcher so far. Makes you wonder why no one else came up with the idea to lay out your screens to minimize swipe after swipe to get to what you're looking for.Unfortunately, that's also the only great thing I see here. The app drawer appears forgotten, lacking the ability to drag and sort, or create folders to group apps in. (GoLauncher does this for free, btw) The interface has a little sluggishness to it, which never helps. It runs okay on my Thunderbolt (rooted and running DasBAMF 1.8.6 Remix), and looks kindof like crap on my Galaxy Tab 10.1 (stock), (but so far, everything else does too, so no love lost here).Then there is the killer, which took this from a four star app to three, and I even considered two because this was the reason I uninstalled: when my phone reboots I get a message several times telling me that Amazon AppStore is no longer installed. I assume this nuisance alert appears because some Amazon service is still starting up, but why should my app launcher care what market/store I have installed? Must have something to do with licensing, but I think this is as unnecessary as it is annoying. Just open my apps and display my widgets, and don't tell me what needs to be installed, outside of what installed with your launcher."

Also I gave this link to a friend of mine with an atrix, which has duel cores and a bigger active memory base, he says it also slows down his entire device. so clearly they need to do some heavy optimization.The Lock screen mimic's the iPhone lock screen, which again is very slow to response and feels clunky and slow to respondThe one touch application menu in the center is a pretty slick idea.The addition of instant access to your Text messaging program is pretty cool, but it' not really setup for customizationIt has potential but it has a hell of a long way to go to get there.I'm giving this two stars because it has possibilities and some rather interesting ideas, nothing terrible innovative or remarkable.

Allowing all of these stupid review is ruining your market.

The police/fire feed for the county where 90% of my daily commuting takes place provides me valuable warning on road problems that traffic reporters would be telling me about far too late...if at all.Easy to use; search by name, genre or location, or search for any audio within a radius near you. No stability issues running on an anHTC Evo 4gVery few differences between this and thepaidversion. Paid version drops ads, and adds a pause/play button that is persistent between sessions (and you can run the free and paid version at the same time to follow two programming sources)."

I have both a base station scanner in my house and a hand held scanner for mobile use when I go on trips but i'll bet they haven't been turned on more than ten or fifteen times in the years that I've had them. Listening to scanner calls as a steady diet is somewhat distracting to me. As a point of reference I was a licensed ham radio operator and CB radio operator. I never put my mobile transceiver in my car at all any more nor turn on my base station radio transceiver anymore either. I don't think my base station transceiver's antenna coaxial cable is even hooked up to the radio anymore as well. For you scanner junkies out there the Scanner Radio app will work just fine on your tablet or android phone and you can listen to scanner calls to your heart's content. One of my best friends is a consummate scanner monitor listener and has his scanners running all of his waking hours at home. In any event, happy listening on the Scanner Monitor app to the rest of you."

Then you need scanner radio free at the App store. This app works with the help of wi-fi the thing that most of the world depends on. If you want to know what is going on near you, you can search on the search selection and type in your state, country, city, or zip code and all you have to do is choose one out of the many options that pop up. This app has no lag and will keep you on alert so you know where the bad boys are. So what are you waiting for? The world to end. I don't think so. Its time to get this app because it has your name on it saying download me. Chill out and relax with scanner radio."

It's really cool as well that you can search the world for a city's radio to listen to. The only reason I don't give it 5 stars is beucase on the free version, there are certain featuers that are lacking. i.e. you can't use the &#34;play/pause/stop&#34; button at the top of the screen unless you pay for it but you can still hit the back button and do the same thing if you want it to stop. :)"

Many times when the channels get busy they overlap and it's hard to understand.  I have downloaded this on my Kindle and on my Samsung Blaze...both worked fine.  Cheap entertainment app. :)"

My handheld transceiver has good range, but still doesn't pick up as much as the area police feed provided online.  Many areas I visit often have numerous feeds available, and is also helpful when I want to program frequencies into my transceiver.  I'm definitely planning on going Pro so I have access to more features, but the free version of this app is very feature rich and stable.  It does eat up the battery pretty quickly, even with earbuds, but I have plenty of adapters to keep my phone powered up.  I'm very pleased with the RadioReference.com Scanner Radio app, and heartily recommend it to an scanner enthusiast."

This is one of those apps that has its place for all of us that wish we were part of the action, but glad we're not.  After 25+ years in law enforcement, and have owned several scanners in my time, and although I don't currently own the latest in a digital spread spectrum top of the line scanner.  I still have a digital scanner in my pocket thanks to scanner radioYa gotta love those guys and gals who of there own free will take the time to set up there own scanners and allow those of us that want to listen can listen.  I would hazard a guess that most of us have a favorite or two or three set frequencies if you will, well, with this app, you can set up your favorites list and you can just pick and chose which one you want to listen to for the first hour or two.  Or maybe one of your favorites is quiet tonight, you take a chance and see whats going on in the land down under, yep, we can listen to the brave men and women in uniform in Australia.  While its no hand held scanner that you can set up, program, have an antenna on the roof of your home and all, bt this isn't a bad substitute, try it, couldn't hurt, you may just be the next action junkie.  Have fun with this, don't become an ambulance chaser, you may wind up being the topic of discussion for that evening, not sayin, just sayin, be smart and be safe, enjoy the app for what it is."

Kudos to the designer and to the volunteers who lend their scanners to provide this app.  The coverage of local police, fire and EMT service seems excellent, and the small ads are not too intrusive.  The site is very easy to navigate and a list of police codes is included.  There is even an archive if you want to review prior dates, but it requires a paid subscription so I haven't checked it out.  I find it hard to tear myself away from the live police chatter, even though it's usually quite routine.  Update 4-27-13 -- The alerts accurately tell you when there are more listeners than usual in a certain area.  Today I listened in on Australia loud and clear.  I'm impressed!"

The feeds this app use are actually available to listen to for free online, but it is a cool user interface for your smart phone."

I've had it for quite awhile too and none in my area have been added to the app. It does have a search bar and you can search for any department/area/city....I'd recommend it, just not if you're looking for your city and if you live in the middle of no where!"

It crashes constantly, even when I am not using it.Not only is the instability pathetic, but that is exacerbated by the fact that there is no option to tell this dumb thing I don't want it to constantly run (and crash, apparently) in the background. How hard would it be to have an option for that?It makes no effort to keep track of your actual reading progress.  It remembers the last page viewed, which is insufficient because jumping to the index or end notes to check something results in the Kindle app assuming that to be your new current reading progress. Unless you manually bookmarked the page every time, progress is lost. It would be incredibly simple to have a default bookmark which keeps track of the highest page you actually flipped to in 1-page increments, rather than merely the last page displayed.It does let you change the text size and background color, which is worth a couple stars."

    "summary": "Not enough features, slow searching, poor font rendering",
    "reviewText": "It does the job, sort of.  But for being the only ebook reader app for the most popular source of ebooks--namely, Amazon--it is very sadly lacking in features.  Just compare to ebook readers like Moon+ or Mantano and Android, or even ebook readers on obsolete platforms like Plucker for PalmOS (which I was a developer for).My comments are skewed by the fact that I am a scholar in the humanities, and so my needs are for study rather than just linear reading.Here are some specifics:1. The search is unacceptably slow.  For instance, to search my approximately 6mb ebook, it took six minutes on my Archos 43.  Compare that to 22 seconds with Moon+, or about 50 seconds with Plucker on PalmOS on a much slower device (200MHz versus 1000MHz).  Search is the main advantage of electronic texts for serious students of the texts.  Without a decent speed search, there is little advantage except convenience.  And it would be good to have some more search options (phrase, word, boolean, etc.).2. The subpixel font rendering assumes horizontal RGB striping.  This means that the subpixel algorithm fails, producing faint color shadows near letters, in all orientations other than one (on my Archos 43, it works in portrait, but fails in others;  on my wife's Kindle Fire, it works in landscape, but fails in others).  It's not such a big deal on my Archos 43, as the pixels on it are so small.  This is easy to fix: just turn off subpixel rendering and replace it with grayscale antialiasing, or add an option to do that.  And I bet it works badly in all orientations on OLED devices that don't use uniform RGB stripes at all.  (The best would be to auto-detect based on orientation and screen type.  But I don't know if Android includes an API for getting RGB striping information.  On the Kindle Fire's version of the app, though, you could just go on orientation, since you know which way the RGB is striped there.)  Subpixel rendering for the wrong orientation is worse than grayscale rendering.3. More color options, please.  It would take only a few minutes for the developer to add a bunch more color options.  (I know, because I'm a developer for a PDF viewer for Android.)  For instance, green on black is great for reading at night.  Red on black is essential if you want to preserve night vision.  Black on sepia is nicer than brown on sepia.  And why not just let the user customize it?4. I wish the viewer would optionally let you move through the text by scrolling rather than paging.  Paging isn't quite so good for complex scholarly texts, as it's harder to think about a sentence or paragraph that is broken across screens.  Much easier if you can just scroll it so the text you're thinking about fits on one screen.5. There should be an option to eliminate all margins (on a small screen device, one doesn't need more than about two pixels).  The tightest margin setting still has too much margin.6. Optionally, make the main screen be just a list of titles, like on eink Kindles.  Lists with book cover thumbnails make sense only for small collections of books, and presumably you'd like users to have large connections. :-)7. I can't find a way to categorize books.  There should be one.What do I like?- stability- easy downloads- correct formatting- number of books available"

I loaded up my Kindle app, and finished the books on the flights that I had received for Christmas...had my daily scripture reading, and added little weight to my luggage and more importantly...took little space in my luggage!  Since my trip, I have continued reading at night in bed with my Kindle app and no longer have to worry about getting up to turn off the light.  The more I use it, the more I like it...and I recently learned that I can &#34;check out&#34; books from the public library, and am no longer limited to the large print section!  Also, my husband and I often like to read a book the other has purchased.  With large numbers, books can be &#34;loaned&#34; to the other.  Wonderful!"

Bundle books become one long book and all the books I have read have yet to have an option of jumping or returning to a page or chapter.

I personally prefer Adobe Digital Editions and the Nook apps (Barnes & Noble), but mostly just because I am more familiar, having used them both first, and I actually would rather have a paper book than any of them.

It's so easy to operate my kids can do it. Even I can do it. Bookmark my page and pick up where I left off with no hassle. Now I can use my tablet for what I bought it for--a portable library. It's so easy to go to amazon, find my book, download it and read.

My only issue is I can't create collections so that I can store the books I have read, in a folder, while allowing the ones I haven't read to be out in the open. But other than that, I have no complaints.edited to add:  I have found that I can delete the books off of my tablet and they remain in my Kindle acct @Amazon.  So while I still can't put them in collections, I can remove them without losing them forever.This app would be also be better if the sorter worked better. I find that some of my books appear under the \"Most Recent\" not in the order that I bought them. This creates an issue with me as I have a lot of books downloaded and would like to read the oldest ones first. Sometimes the newest ones I bought down at the bottom where the oldest ones are located. I also notices that if I update the books because of the author correcting errors, that the book then appears at the top where my newest books are located. The original buy date should be used for sorting by most recent."

    "reviewText": "I used to like Kindle. The app was fast and reliable, and made it easy to read an ebook from Amazon on my Nook Color (with N2A).Then I bought a couple of new Kindle books, and Kindle (the app) would not download them unless I updated the app. The new app starts with a gray sphere and freezes there for a long time. Then it loads, and the default screen is not my library but the Kindle store with recommendations. A few buttons later I finally get to select my book and read it. Meanwhile, the app still doesn't allow you to group the books by topic.This spells the end of Kindle for me. I'll move my books over to Calibre, which doesn't try to sell anything and does allow for sorting books."

It could definitely be better though.Amazon needs to sync personal documents as well as purchased books. If this is a mobile platform for my books why can't all my books come over? Some may point out that personal documents have delivery fees, but that is only using Amazon's 3G and this app uses our networks. Also, why not let us target our app instead of or along with our Kindle? This would require us to be given a unique @Kindle.com email address, but it could work.I also want the app to sync highlighted notes / clippings from when I read on my Kindle.Finally, I want to be able to highlight and share quotes from my clippings like on my Kindle.This app works, but not better than Aldiko and definitely not better than a real Kindle."

Most pros are advantages of any Kindle, with smaller form-factor.Con:- Most cons are about poor UI.- Too difficult to take desired actions after reading a sample- Kindle Store and Amazon.com are SO unrelated, one wonders:(1) Was there ANY Systems Integration in programming process?(2) Does ANYONE in Marketing or Sales want to make it easy (maybe user-friendly) for us to purchase content (that we have decided we want)? Or to let our WishLists know what we WANT?- should integrate WELL with both Amazon mobile apps & with full web-site.- \"Don't judge book by it's cover?\" Bad enough that e-readers lose the sensory aspects of reading - but the lag-time (till next download or more) to SEE the cover? If we can't have \"feel\" of a book, would be nice to have more of the \"look\"- Many features not available. Example: During past year, Many Kindle-benefits are advantages of Amazon Prime Membership. BUT, these features are not compatible w this app.With all these cons, and I could list more, why am I giving 3 stars, instead of 1-2? I don't own a Kindle - nor, would I always carry it. So, this app lets me read content anywhere, from phone."

The ability to add support for lookup in user defined wikis would be great too.Highlighting text spanning more than one page can be difficult or impossible.  Regarding selection of text, is being able to copy a sentence no more than a few times a day such a problem for publishers? This would be useful for quoting books.Otherwise this app is the best reader I've used, though the first point makes it necessary to have another reader installed."

It gives me the best of everything. I am never without a book now but have no more piles of books all over. The sync between Android &amp; Kindle works flawlessly for me. Books can be archived online so I can go back &amp; read again. This is great for me because I love series fiction and sometimes forget things before the next book comes out. There is some content you can't get with the app you can with Kindle. I think maybe Amazon wants to keep a few things out of the app so people still buy Kindles. Something else that makes having both worthwhile is that Kindle is totally non glare so you can read outside but not backlit (which is easier on the eyes) while my phone has backlight so I can read in dark/dim light."

I frequently use this program in the subway, it is great for when you want to relax but you don't have a cell signal to run some other programs.The real benefit of reading through the Kindle app as opposed to some alternatives is that the checkout process is lightning-fast. You can also frequently get free books for Kindle, so not only am I able to read more conveniently, but more cheaply, too!I am currently running it on my Droid 2 Global running Froyo (2.2), and have had no problems. While you can't download onto a tablet or AT&T; phone through the Amazon Appstore yet, you can get this through the Android Market on those devices."

    "reviewText": "Before I had a kindle I tried the kindle app on my Droid X2 and took to it like a fish to water. I find the android version especially good for reading in bed with the lights out. Like when your better half is sleeping. I switch the text to white, background to black, and the brightness on the lowest setting and all is good. The potential detraction of the small screen is well made up for by the light weight & ease of handling with the phone. I can easily one-hand it and switch positions without much fuss. With a little practice, I can even change pages with one hand, swiping with my thumb. I've also found this app convenient for waiting room time at doctors & dentist appointments.With the addition of whispersynch, I can switch between my kindle and android phone with ease. Each time, the current device offers to take me right to where I was reading on the other device and with a click, I'm right where I left off.  Heh, I can imagine a decade from now explaining to the youngsters about the days before whispersynch, much to their disbelief and bemusement. Cheers."

Buy once and read on all your devices is misleading.  I just bought a new phone and can't put half my books on it because it says I ran out of licenses for that book so they want me to buy them again or get rid of some of my devices!  Sounds like false advertising!  I am one that HATES to read but LOVE my kindle (no kidding!), I've read more books since I got my kindle than I have in 20 years because I really like the kindle but now I'm getting where I can't even put all my content on my devices out of fear of losing access to them all if I keep upgrading so be careful with adding lots of kindle software to all your devices as you just might run out of access to your library.  By the way, I'm the only one with access to my devices as I have to family to share them with, so there will never be 2 devices reading anything at the same time.....just me with lots of gadgets and now I can't even put my library on all my devices....5 stars if advertising was correct.....BUY ONCE, READ EVERYWHERE?????  More like buy once, read on first few devices you install it on and don't upgrade either or you can lose access to your library.....Either way I still like my kindle keyboards that have all my books on them although I'm afraid to upgrade them now.......Danny"

I'm able to instantly look up an unfamiliar word rather than guessing at the meaning. Seriously, do you keep reading or run to find a dictionary when you come across one of &#34;those&#34; words? I'm able to easily highlight passages I want to remember. I can shop for a favorite/new book any time, anywhere. I don't have to buy more bookcases or find places for my books. It's simple (and free) to find and read those classics I always told myself I would read &#34;someday&#34;. Kindle even has sales on books. I have discovered new favorite authors by taking advantage of the countless free books offered daily. My grandchildren know Grandma always has a new book to read to them. I still love bookstores, but Kindle gives me so much more to choose from and this store is always open!"

I just downloaded it on my 7\" tablet, and it's even better than before, now with the larger screen size, it's no different than reading a paperback novel that you would buy in the stores now-a-days. You can get quite a few books from the Kindle Book store for the same price as 1 book retail in the stores. They have tons of free books, and alot more pretty cheap."

It's a little more cumbersome to get your books off the cloud, but once downloaded to your android (Galaxy tablet in my case), this works out just fine. On the Asus and Dell Windows 8.1 tablets (which are actually PCs), it's even more difficult to access the cloud for previously purchased books. I won't take any stars away for that, but only because there may be an easier way and I'm new to Win8 tablets. (Aren't we all?) Considering how many android apps there are, however, I am at a point where I can say that Android is far easier to deal with vis a vis Kindle and apps in general."

All my books! Each & every one of them! So frustrating! I've contacted support about this twice for no answers. My sister's has done the same thing several times as well.Also I understand that Kindle users have the option of categorizing or organizing their books - wish we with the app could do that too. To mark them as read, unread or make a note regarding the book. Also to be able to leave a review for a book directly from the app as opposed to logging into Amazon to do so.We have no way to remove the books from our device once they are downloaded. They just continue to clutter up the device unless you choose to delete them entirely from your Amazon library. Some books that's ok for but then some books you might want to keep & loan out but not have them remain on your device.I noticed we have not had an update on the app since 2011...please give us categories, a way to mark them, option to remove books from device & leave in our library, a way to leave a review on a book without opening a browser & getting to Amazon and fix the bug that causes the app to move our books to Archive without our permission!"

The vendor of the ePad said Kindle would not work without a difficult download of an older version of the app; then an update by replacing it with a new app.  None of that was required.

    "reviewText": "I love that I can carry the works of Lovecraft and a couple history books, and more, on my phone.  The app works great for reading.  A phone, even with the bigger screens on new phones, is not perfect, but since you have your phone nearly 24/7, this is a great way to kill any down time you get hit with.The synch feature is great if you have a kindle.  When you load up a document you've also read on the Kindle, it offers to move you to the furthest page you've reached.  This is the one flaw, however.  If you load up the app to check your position and update to where you are on a Kindle, you can't back out of the app without losing your place.  There's no quit option, and the phone's equivalent of escape simply undoes the synch, then lets you quit.  You're required to continue reading, I guess.Still, the app is amazing, free, and is a gateway to a great many books which are also free, in addition to whatever you might buy.EDIT - Touch the text of the book to bring up the various menus and symbols, then hit the Kindle symbol in the upper left to exit the book without losing your place.  Not exactly intuitive, but it works."

So far, it has twice posted an error saying (something to the effect) that the titles I downloaded were not properly registered and to delete and download them again. They read properly after each new download, but I can't say it won't happen again. Just hope it isn't right after I've boarded a plane.The satisfaction of immediately reading a purchase (after download - I don't do clouds), having a library (which can contain groups) in such a small package, and the typical cost savings between the electronic and the tree editions of a publication are definite pros. Also, the dictionary works well, and I like that books reopen where I left off.On the other hand, I have failed to determine where the downloads are being saved. I want to force them to my external SD card since my internal memory is limited and many applications won't run from anywhere else. I can't find any setting for selecting the download destination, and haven't been able to find the actual files, yet, to see where they've been saved. Even if they are going where I'd like, I consider the inability to specify a location an irritating omission.I would still recommend this product, particularly since it's 1) free, 2) easy to use, and 3) removable."

Number one being that there are no page numbers and sometimes there is no way to navigate chapters. If you lose your place at times you have to flip through and hope to find it again or trial and error. There needs to be a page location that is not just 374 out of 1000, which doesn't reflect the page number. The other thing I don't like is that you can't organize your books. There is no way to make a book playlist by author or by name. I wanted to separate the same author books into the proper series to read by and it won't let me at all, which is frustrating. Other than that though, it is a good app and swiftly allows downloads of new items. Also multiple book bundles get a little wonky when trying to find another book within the bundle to read."

I have over 50 or so books on it so far and was just a few weeks ago talking to my mom about getting a Kindle. It is convenient for me to have the computer app though as I am a full time student getting a degree in Internet Marketing/New Media online so I spend a great deal of time on my computer. It has become a part of me at this point, I think.But, I also downloaded the Kindle app for my Android phone which I was asked to review. It absolutely makes me so angry I see red and I am a pretty laid back person about technology because when you deal with them all the time; you must learn patience for those days that they have minds of their own.But, seriously, the Kindle app for my Android worked fine for the first 2 books I got. Ever since, it has been a battle between me, the app, and the Amazon site as the app will not sync all of the books I have on all of my other apps. I have done everything I can think of. I have uninstalled it and re-installed it 2 times and still nothing. I find it so frustrating because I really really want it to work. I LOVE the kindle idea. I live in an apartment and do not have a ton of room for hard cover books. Whoever thought up the Kindle idea is brilliant. It is perfect for people now a days who are always on the go; but I BEG of you, Amazon, re-evaluate your Android Kindle App PLEASE!!! PRETTY PLEASE!! It was so great having those first 3 books with me everywhere I went.Thank you for your time and I do hope if you do download the app as I did; you all have better luck.Regards,~ Holley Jacobs"

I have found that in using an Android tablet, in my case it's a Pandigital SuperNova, you should have your Amazon Kindle archive account listed as a favorite in your browser. This way you can go to your book list and simply tell it to download to which device you are using.As with most anything you get or do with Amazon you can't go wrong. It's all good."

    "reviewText": "I love the Kindle app.  I've had it on two Android phones (Moment and Evo), an iTouch, and two iPads (1 & 2).  It works perfectly on all of them!!  I've never had it crash.I know this is a review for the Android version, but I only mention my other devices because of the fact that I love how it sync's information between devices.  I did not know this as I had read most of a book on an iTouch and then stopped reading it for a few months.  When I installed it on my Evo I re-downloaded the book thinking I might go ahead and finish it but was concerned that I might not remember where I left off.  but when I opened the book, it took me right to the spot I had left off.I must say, this impresses the living daylights out of me!!  Thank you, Amazon, for adding that as a feature.Otherwise, it does everything you need in a book reader.  You can bookmark, you can change the size of the text, you can even change the coloring (I prefer Sepia when reading during the day and Black when reading at night).  In the Android version you can even \"share\" your progress so you can brag about what you've read to all your friends or those who might be reading with you.  You can even shop for books right inside the app.I love this and it is no wonder that Kindle is such a strong contender in the eReader fields and it is always the first ebook reader I install any time I get a compatible device.  I look forward to what they release in the future as I'm sure it will only get better."

    "reviewText": "After resisting a full year, I got a kindle as a gift. It took 3 days to warm up to it. It took 2 weeks before I was addicted. After 3 months, my husband threatened to divorce me. I got an android phone. This was my first downloaded app. I thought the kindle was wonderful. This app takes kindle to a whole new level. I won't go into the free and low cost books, the instant no fuss no muss whispernet delivery. I will say that I love the responsive page turning, the double tap highlight, the COLOR interface (book cover art is important when picking my next read!) I was surprised that I didn't hate the backlighting which by the way, can be adjusted by the user and can be read outside (although admittedly strong sunlight is still an issue).  Not only can you control brightness, you can control the page color (3 choices- white, sepia and black). As on kindle, you can pick your fonts and size. You can mark passages, look up words, and search.  You can read in either landscape or portrait (I find landscape flows better.  I can pull it out anywhere and I don't get the stares I used to when I pulled out my kindle (picture standing in line at the grocery). I love that it doesn't eat my battery. I read an entire book over a 4 hour period and still had over 60% left on my battery on an android phone. The kindle app doesn't have text to speech (that I have found) but that isn't an issue for me. Awesome app and it is free!! You can't go wrong."

Installed nook and converted my books to epub with calibre. Apparantly Barnes &amp; Noble want people to use their app. nook color looking more appealing than a kindle right now. /sigh..... i really liked the kindle app to. sad day for me"

I think I installed the Kindle reader first.  It's a nice implementation and I can't think of anything off hand that I would do to improve the user interface EXCEPT you should be able to see the time while reading.  Doh.  I don't want to have to exit the reader to see what time it is.  Ok, so the Archos 43 has a large screen, and I can see that one might not want to use up the screen real estate that way on a smaller screen - but make it an option then.  Please.  Pretty please.---2012/11/29 Update:  The app can open PDFs, so it is not necessary to have another PDF reader taking up space on your device.  I love that.  I hate that Amazon apps are HUGE and get more HUGE with every update.  This should be App2SD.  I'm going to downgrade my 5 rating to 4 on this point alone.  I love the reader, but the size of the app is making me have to uninstall other stuff to keep it on.  At some point, the Amazon app is going to have to go so I can keep the other stuff on the tablet.  Get a clue Amazon.  You are in the app store business.  When your apps take up all the room on the device, people can't buy other apps anymore!"

Really gives me a true location to where I currently am in the book.. this feature also estimates the time to the end when I open a book that I have already read, basing its estimate on how long it took me the last time to read cover to cover. Not necessarily needed info but nice to know what I average from book to book. This app will stay on my RAZR Maxx until I buy a Kindle Fire later this fall."

Tonight when I clicked on \"store\", it took me to Amazon's actual Web page which is much more difficult to navigate on my little tablet (Samsung galaxy). I'm hoping this is just a glitch and not an actual change.I had previously installed both the Kindle app and the Nook app, but after a month or so I realized that I liked the Kindle app much better and deleted the Nook app. Now I'm hoping I don't have to go back to that one. Please fix!!Okay. . . so about two days later I figured out that I may possibly have been the one who just didn't know what I was doing. It's back to working for me now, so I have changed my review to 5 stars. Love this app!"

I've only found two sentences like that. My other suggestion is that maybe the books could be a little cheaper. I don't have the room on my Android tablet to keep all of my favorite books, so I might have to delete them in order to download others. That's a little bit of a waste of money on my part.

    "reviewText": "Not too bad of an app. It's one of the most well-known e-readers for a reason: it's simple to pick up and use - even for those with very little experience with smartphones. The library is simple to browse and find what you're looking for, which seems to be a complaint for a lot of e-readers. It also keeps track of your progress automatically, so if you're the type to read multiple novels at once, then this app is sure to please!Would prefer if there was an easy way to upload / link books from anywhere, but it looks as though you can ONLY read books from the amazon kindle store unless you manually put them on the phone / SD card through a USB cable. Other than that limitation, it works like it's supposed to and doesn't drain the battery too much. Watch out when buying, though! While there are a ton of cheap / free books, and Amazon isn't shy about showing you the more expensive stuff. One-tap ordering means you can easily purchase something you didn't want if you don't pay attention.Overall, it's not spectacular, but it works like it should and is an app that no one should pass up."

That just changed, I received an Android tablet (10.7 inch) for my birthday in January, and didn't do much with it until recently. I was in Amazon App store to download a timer for poker when I came across the Kindle app. So I downloaded that as well, while looking to order a new book from one of my favorite authors, I noticed that he had written several short stories for the Kindle only. I ordered the stories, and was delighted with the ease of operation in downloading to the tablet, the ease in reading while in bed, on the couch, room lights on or off. I am definitely a believer in e-books now. I still like print books for the beach and pool, but the Kindle is great for the other times that weather is not an issue for electronics. Definitely recommend this to all the readers out there."

In fact the \"Table of Contents\" in the menu will not even take you to a  'Table of Contents'. To change books in the Bible I have to:1. go to the menu2. choose Navigation3. from there I can choose  'Table of Contents'4. choose book5 choose chapterBy then it is too late. Other books don't have a \"Navigation\" choice. How about a 'Go to  'Table of Contents' ' in the  'Table of Contents' tab...come on this is common sense. Why even call it  'Table of Contents' if it does not take you there."

We both used the older Kindle tablets that didn't have the back lit screen, so always needed some kind of additional lighting if reading in a dim area or in the evening.  I decided to download this app for my Nexus 7 and am quite pleased with it.  I am able to access the entire library and read in darkened areas without fumbling with some type of additional light source.  It has been great for reading while on airplanes, camping or when I'm some place where lighting isn't adequate to read from my old Kindle tablet.  I also downloaded it on my wife's Ipad as well as the kid's Coby tablet, but have not tried it on the Coby as of yet.  The downside is, the Nexus 7 and Coby have to be in a area where there's WiFi access to download from Amazon or access books in our stored library, whereas, the Kindle tablet has fairly reliable satellite access, similar to a cell phone.  This is not a big problem, as I download several books to the Nexus 7 memory before I go anywhere there may be limited or no WiFi access."

However, unless I will be traveling, or unless I plan to sit down and read for an extended period of time, I tend to not want to carry around the full-sized Kindle reader device with me.  I would prefer to use my phone, or read on my computer.  Enter the Kindle reader for the Android. It works beautifully.  It auto-syncs when you first start it, and then you can turn pages by slide-gesturing, or using the arrow keys on the keypad (if you have a keypad on your Android phone). You can also highlight, and annotate, as well as increase or lower font size, line spacing, etc.  The only thing it won't do, is read to you like the Kindle can do, when you enable screen-reading.  Not too shabby for a free application.Battery drain while using it to read non-stop for 2 hours was about 35% of my total battery life, on a battery which will give me 4 hours with constant use, with a full charge.  Not bad, but not fantastic, either.  However, the Samsung Galaxy Indulge has pretty terrible battery life in general (I always carry a spare with me), so take that estimate with a grain of salt, your mileage may vary."

    "reviewText": "Everything you love about your Kindle is now on your Android phone! I love this app because it allows me to pick up reading a book where I left off reading on the PC or other Kindle device.The recent addition of access to public library books is great! (However, this still needs to be done via the Internet outside of the app - hopefully they will integrate into the app in the future) I can borrow books from my public library for free for 2 weeks at a time! I love this, I will probably save a good deal of money in late fees because when the lending period expires, the book is automatically returned! No need to worry about getting to the library to return a book in order to avoid late fees!This app is constantly updated and improved as well, but it has been extremely good for quite some time now. I love that the reading background colors, brightness, text size, and word spacing can all be adjusted to fit your needs or preferences.A great way to make good use of my time while in waiting rooms!"

One of the things that I have loved about it is that when I click on the \"store\" button, it takes me to the app version of Amazon.  Tonight when I clicked on \"store\", it took me to Amazon's actual Web page which is much more difficult to navigate on my little tablet (Samsung galaxy).  I'm hoping this is just a glitch and not an actual change.I had previously installed both the Kindle app and the Nook app, but after a month or so I realized that I liked the Kindle app much better and deleted the Nook app.  Now I'm hoping I don't have to go back to that one.  Please fix!!Okay. . . so about two days later I figured out that I may possibly have been the one who just didn't know what I was doing.  It's back to working for me now, so I have changed my review to 5 stars.  Love this app!"

I will go from 15 mins left on the first page of a chapter to 36 minutes left on the last page of the chapter.  I know my reading speed hasn't changed, but about every 2-3 pages, it likes to add a minute to the remaining time.I am currently using the Note 3, however the 2nd problem also existed on the Evo 4G I was using for a bit.Once these two items are taken care of, I will be more than happy to change it back to a 5-star rating, as this truly is one of the better reading apps."

    "reviewText": "These may seem like minor, insignificant complaints to you, and they would be if there were any legal alternative to the Kindle app.  Unfortunately, when I buy an ebook on Amazon, I'm locked in to their apps/devices, so I can't read the book the way I want.  Amazon isn't doing me a favor by making an ebook app that works for me, they owe it to me.Margins:When I read a physical book, there are reasonable margins.  When I read a DRM-free ebook on a feature-rich open source e-reader app on my galaxy tab, I have reasonable margins between the edge of the screen and the edge of the tablet.  When I read a Kindle ebook on the Kindle app on my galaxy tab, I have EXTRA LARGE margins in portrait mode thanks to the built in, non-configurable software margins.  When I tilt the tablet a few degrees too far to the right or left (surprisingly easy to do when you have the tablet tilted back a little), I get EXTRA LARGE margins on the top and bottom of the screen, and DELUXE SUPER JUMBO margins on the right and left.Screen Rotation:On my phone, the Kindle app is great.  The software margins aren't an issue since my phone doesn't have built in margins around the screen, and I can tell the Kindle app not to change orientations when I tilt the phone by pressing a mysterious lock icon that appears when I tilt it.  On my tablet, the Kindle app team has decided that users don't like locking the screen rotation, so they've completely removed that feature.  They say that it's easy to lock the screen rotation in Android 3.0, but it's actually only one click less to lock the screen in Android 3.0 than to lock it in Android 2.X, plus there's the fact that I don't want to have to enter Kindle App Mode every time I try to read a Kindle ebook.The only reason I'm giving it two stars rather than one is because the Kindle app is still at least twice as good as the Barnes and Noble Nook app, for what it's worth."

I decided to try it, I use iTunes anyway on my computer. It was amazing! It was fast, transferred all my songs and cover art, and on top of that all my playlists.This is by far one of the best apps I've purchased through the years and well worth the cost. For smooth syncing and music control from computer to phone and back again don't fear wasting your money on this app."

Even restored Kindle to new condition and tried again. Customer service was prompt in responding and suggested I download their (free) music player and use that one instead of Amazon's.  Worked like a charm and now this is JUST what I needed.  Maybe I missed it, but never saw that piece of advice in my installation instructions, so I would recommend they add that so people like me don't get confused (I'm pretty tech savvy too, so if I didn't get it, I'm sure others would benefit from that bit of info!).

I figured I could save the cost of upgrading to a newer iPod by just copying podcasts from my iTunes library to my new KFHD8.9. I couldn't find any easy way to do this until December 28, 2012 when Amazon featured iSyncr at a discount and so caught my attention. I purchased it and it turned out to be exactly what I needed. I did have to experiment with various settings to finally understand the terminology and to adjust the options to my liking. I prefer syncing over USB because the syncing control panel on the PC is more understandable to me and easier to use than the panel on the KFHD. Now, any time I update my podcasts in iTunes on my desktop PC I am just a few clicks away from having everything synced for listening on my KFHD."

Songbird would take for-ev-er to mount the SD card, Doubletwist recopied all my songs every time and HTC sync took five minutes to update the library and then at least an hour and a half to sync playlists and then copy songs.  I could find no program that seemed to sync as quickly and accurately as iTunes synced my iPod Touch. Now I have.I'm using iSyncr for both my HTC Evo phone and my Acer Iconia tablet. I had trouble with a couple of songs the first couple of times I tried to sync, but once I unchecked those and ran one full sync (about 4500 songs) they synced fine the second time.  Of course the first sync took a long time since the songs had to be copied fully.  What has amazed me is how iSyncr performs on subsequent syncs.  It seems to sync only what has changed and gets the sync over and done with.  I can now sync whenever I want - I don't have to set aside time to make sure the sync happens. I can sync and go - just like iTunes works with my iPod Touch.To the developer:  THANK YOU."

The free version does the trick if you know what you are looking for.  Otherwise you might get a bunch of stations that you need to listen through before you get to what you really want.  The buffering is a bit bad.  I'd get alot of dropped signals when listening to stations in the gym.  Not sure if that is an app issue or the station stream."

I had to have a sleep timer, I had to be able to add and modify an assortment of streams, had to play in the background, not a memory hog, good customer support, active program updates.  That shouldn't be too hard to find, those things, it is.  XiiaLive matches beautifully.Not only did I get what I needed, but also some really cool features I hadn't even thought of like the little alert sounds, which are extremely informative in the dark.  I listen to audio streams while nodding off to sleep so when it has to buffer or I drop connection, I don't have to physically look to see what happened.  I very rarely drop connection, but when I reconnect, I love the ball drop sound upon connection.I'm sure this app does more than I'm telling you, but for me, this is the best one and I'm picky."

Also, I wish I could search by location as I'd rather listen to something local or from a specific country. No major complaints, but nothing about this blew me away either. If you are looking for Internet radio, try the trial first before dropping upwards of five dollars on this."

Got as a FAOTD, but one of the select few really worth paying for. Nice UI as well. If  you're looking for an all-around radio app, this is it!"

This is clearly stated in the description *XiiaLive is a fabulous app. I like the variety of options you're given. You can view your history, tag songs you'd like to remember, set alarms, change the theme, even scan stations.The interface is clean and it offers alternatives when I'm tired of listening to the same songs on my Mp3 player and the radio.One feature I appreciate about TuneIn that this app doesn't have is the ability to easily search using city and state. XiiaLive's results are shown as one long, random list, no categorizing or in any kind of order. And you have to type in the call letters / city yourself instead of conveniently choosing from a list.There is also no way to easily access the app. Instead of being able to simply swipe down the menu and see song info, you have to go all the way into the app from the homepage. Major design flaw and major annoyance.That being said, I've discovered some great online radio stations and new music. I dig this app and recommend it."

Not everything I listened to was really what I would define as &quot;pub&quot; music, which I would define as something you'd hear at an Irish session.I also tried the Wacken station because I thought it'd have a decent selection of heavy metal. I haven't had time to listen it a lot, but I thought the Pogues was an interesting choice for a metal channel.Anyways, these seem like random Internet channels and I'm entirely convinced that all of them are good. Maybe it's just what I'm into. I'll play around with it more and see where it ends up."

On this,or any other music app, I rarely see any comments regarding bit rate&hellip; Which makes me wonder if I am the only person with a mobile data-cap??? This app has a wonderful feature where when you search or browse stations you can filter by a certain bit rate of your choosing. For those of us with a data limit, this is amazingly useful. While I really like listening to Internet radio, I have no intention of using all of my mobile data in a short few days.Other nice features I didn't find elsewhere include a history of songs listened and the ability to tag a song for later viewing. This is wonderfully useful if you want to download the song from Amazonmp3 later on (when you get to a PC or within wifi?).Unfortunately, I do not see any local radio stations herein, nor any specific feature to pull up your local radio stations based on location, etc.. This is one feature I really like about TuneIn radio.All in all, a good app. Hopefully they continue to improve it, listening to feedback from users, and in the end make it a great music app."

Xiialive has a wider variety of radio stations not found on either iHeart or Tunein. I searched for some of my favorite local stations I use in the other 2 apps and they are not available in xiialive.So instead of using xiialive to replace the other 2 which is what I had hoped it looks like it will compliment the other two apps.UPDATE: This is the FASTEST radio internet app I have used. I don't know how the devs did it but unlike the other internet radio apps you usually have to deal with the connection first then the buffering of the audio. With xiialive I have NOT encountered any buffering or connection issues. Playback is nearly instantaneous. I tried it from a range of radio stations from around the world including different genres and as soon as I selected the station the audio appeared."

The streaming is choppy (cuts out every 5-10 sec), and the app slows down other apps, e.g. words lag when typing on Tweetcaster.I also am confused and perhaps somewhat overwhelmed by what station to choose. The stations listed are the actual station names but don't really have a good description. You just have to assume the stations will play within the genre. I definitely prefer Pandora, which plays the next song based on songs you like and stays within the genre (or you can create your own station). The streaming on Pandora also isn't choppy. Maybe others have had better luck with this app, but I've already uninstalled it from my phone."

So they can easily be used for very nefarious reasons. 2) lazy programming. 3) some valid reason for some system level application that you truly truly trust that actually would need such access (I cannot think of a single example of a user level application that would need this level of access).Unexplained sticky intents in a radio app are EXTREMELY suspicious. They are global and they stick around forever. They also blow past all other permissions and security since they are intended to be used at the SYSTEM level only. No radio app ever needs that level of access! Ever ever ever! Sorry, but no way in heck will I install this and I will definitely warn people about it. I did \"buy it\" as the free app of the day but when I noticed the permissions I did not actually install it and I will not as long as they have these ridiculous permissions embedded in it. Shame on this developer for trying to pull a fast one (or so it seems).In fact, here is a direct quote from a developer of Android itself: \" Er... there is NO reason to use sticky broadcasts for communication within your own app. In fact, I'll go farther and say you just should not do this. Sticky broadcasts are GLOBAL to the system. And because of this, performing a sticky broadcast is multiple orders of magnitude slower than just implementing direct calls within your own app (IPC for each receiver to register, IPC to the system to send it, IPC from the system back to your app to deliver it, marshalling and unmarshalling of all the data within the Intent over both IPCs).More than that, there is NO protection on them, so any other application can watch your sticky broadcasts, or even send their own values back to you. (Btw, this is also issue with using any broadcasts within your own app. Broadcasts are really there for cross-application communication. It is just far more efficient and easier to implement these things within an app by having a callback interface.)Now I am really regretting that I made that function public. :/> And of course, if you want out of application notifications, you have > no other option.You do have the option of using a normal broadcast rather than a sticky broadcast. You'll notice that there are basically no sticky broadcasts used by the system, at least that you see in the public APIs. In fact there are some places they are used internally, but even those are slowly going away as we discover security holes with them because there is no way to protect who can receive the broadcast data.\"If you Google a block of this post you will find the original source Amazon will not allow me to post a link to it. (Update you can find the link to this in Daniel's comment, below! Turns out that links seem to be okay in replies, just not in reviews? At least it wouldn't allow me to do it. No matter, it's there.)"

    "reviewText": "I'm a huge music and radio streamer. I have 4 apps I already use for varying proposes being Pandora, Grooveshark, TuneIn and 8 Tracks. This app is particularly well built and functions rather well. It's got a great UI and it's easy to understand. There's plenty of stations to listen to. Found local and international stations I'm already a fan of. All that said this app simply doesn't bring anything to the table that I don't already have the ability to do and doesn't pack enough to replace any of the apps I have. I'd recommend any of the 4 aforementioned apps before recommending this one but this is one solid app in it's own right. 4 stars!"

    "reviewText": "Very enjoyable app.  Have listened to it for a few months before giving it a review.  As the days have progressed, it has gradually replaced my shortwave and hd radios with more stations to choose from and no need to play the antenna dance.Works great on the k-fire original.  Can run all day if the battery is fully charged.  I find new, enjoyable, unexpected stations almost every day.  Good sound.The only problem occurs when I fastforward too quickly through my list of saved stations.  The programme freezes.  Just restart your device and remember to wait until the station is fully buffered before moving to another channel and you'll be back to business as usual.Well worth the purchase price.  Give it a try."

Occasionally the CPU will get some strange runs of doubles but looking at the stats shows that it is not that bad.  For people really wanting a challenge, I would suggest using a high difficultly level.  It makes some pretty stupid moves, like moving pieces in the home area to a better take off position while there are still pieces outside of the home area.  But maybe the harder difficultly level corrects that."

Either the random algorithm is flawed or it had been intentionally programmed to give the computer opponent an advantage through dice rolls at harder levels instead of more intelligent moves.  I don't think rigging the dice roles is appropriate as a means of increasing difficulty levels.  Not representative of real life at all.  Very disappointed."

You can choose which color you want to be (black or white) and you can pick whether you want to play from north to south or south to north. You can play the computer or a real person. There is a tutorial if you've never played Backgammon.  I highly recommend this game especially if you already know how to play!"

Highly recommend this for experienced backgammon players to sharpen their skills, or for beginners to learn the moves that you should automatically think of when you throw the dice and your numbers come up.Friends have commented that my skill level is approaching deadly :)  of course, I haven't told them why.  LOVE THIS APP. almost as much as I love my Kindle Fire!"

It seems as if the computer \"learns\" from my moves; at least this is how I see it and it makes the game more challenging.  I have it on my phone and Kindle Fire. Many games look too small on a cell phone, making them difficult to play, but this one is not so it makes a good diversion while waiting in line or when I am sitting around, waiting at places such as an auto repair shop or doctor's office."

One thing I like, it does show players not to be too conservative. However it will double at the wrong time and take doubles it should not. I've been rated master, well 35 years ago, so I expect a lot lol. Its free, get it and learn to play, but not for serious players wanting to grow in ability.Entry level only. Well to relieve stress I play it to wipe it out. Then once in 7 series it beats me because I'm taking wild chances and because it starts throwing more doubles and getting perfect rolls. I guess there is luck, it sure gets lucky. :( I think programmed to do that once in a while."

Years ago I used to play daily and entered public tournaments (we were not elite players - just players who were obsessed with backgammon).  However I have not played a lot recently and am not familiar with all the online games or other apps.  I played the app at the most difficult setting and found it worked well and was fun to play.  The app works like a full tablet sized app on my ASUS Transformer tablet.  This app looks good (not as richly colored as checkers but still nice), the pieces move smoothly (no lagging), and the board lights potential moves.  Nice app in my opinion!"

On the hardest level, a win is a victory and the dice always roll in favor of the computer.  It is great that it has a 2 player option that you can use to pass it back and forth for live play. Best of all, it has a great interface that doesn't make you work hard to figure out how to play the darn thing!  The graphics are nice as well.  The free version is ad supported but they the ads aren't annoying and don't interfere with game play."

The game pieces are large enough that it's easy to see and use. Nicely done! As usual with free aps, there is advertisement but it is totally off to one corner and does not interfere with game play. Once in a while there is an offer to download one of their other games, but it is rare and again not a problem."

    "reviewText": "It is important to note that this app is free.  It works well on the Kindle and is definitely worth downloading if you're interested in backgammon even slightly to improve your technique or learn the game itself on a BASIC level.  Although there are 5 levels of AI skill, I found that the moves the AI performed questionable at level 5.  I would rate the maximum level of the AI skill far below any officially world recognized player.  The skill level of the AI is mediocre at best.  In response to some of the other reviewers comments regarding the frequency of doubles in this app there is 'some' validity to their statements.  However I found that the high double roll rates were divided equally between myself and the AI.  I found that the rate of doubles (normally 1 in 6 chances) was only slightly higher at 1 in 5.  With such a small margin between the two ratios I must therefore admit that the RNG (random number generator) is indeed random.If you an advanced player, or world ranked player - don't bother with this app, it will only frustrate you, as if you were playing a novice.  Although that at times can provide it's own challenges due to the unpredictability of their logic or lack of.Bottom line, worth the price of FREE.I use a Kindle Fire HD 8.9 and this app worked with no problems."

After about 3 months and starting to play with a real board and real players, some problems become evident .  To increase levels of difficulty the computer just rolls statistically impossible rolls. Every time it rolls what it needs to hit an unguarded pip. Every time. And it's  strategy becomes very evident. I can predict every move from each roll.  A friend who has this app has also noticed these issues. After playing the real thing  this gets frustrating. And disappointing.  Still, it was a good way to learn and practice strategy."

While you can choose your color if you pick white you have to play upside down--the piece colors are hardwired in. There's no option for automatic double at the beginning of the game--each initial roll results in a clear winner.The authors of the game go out of their way to deny any evidence of cheating, and yet the statistics they provide would seem to belie that. After 80-odd games, the computer has rolled 10% more doubles than me, and I have been hit 30% more often than the reverse (and not for lack of trying). In other words, in the normal course of things the computer is &#34;luckier&#34; than you and will win the majority of games. However, the computer seems to be a sucker for the doubling cube and that is how I have won eight out of ten matches while losing 27 out of 50 games."

The game lets you concentrate on why certain moves are better than others and undo when you go astray and the algorithm smacks you down.On the next update I would and a line that says &quot;Not resigning&quot; when the game score is tied and the next game decides the match, even though its looking bad!  ie, a continue play button for fun's sake.

Difficulty is increased by the computer's ability to get the exact roll that will capture any open game piece.  Your rolls,  on the other hand, are increasingly likely to force leaving a piece open to deny your ability to cover spaces.  I'm sure that programming an AI to &amp;#34;think&amp;#34; is difficult but manipulating the dice roll as a solution is infuriating.  Also, as a general rule, if the AI asks to double, resign the game. I play the game frequently but more often than not (on the higher levels least) I will quit the game out of frustration."

I agree with other comments about how it seems the computer gets more doubles than I, but the handy built in stats screen shows that both players get on average the same number of doubles. What I find annoying is that the computer seems to get more favourable rolls than I do. That is to say that I seem to sit on the bench longer if a guy is captured than the computer does. Ifyour losing to poorly though you can undo and change your moves knowing you both will still get the same rolls.  Like I said I like it overall, and for free who am I to complain?"

I may have to soon, though, because I am playing the game at its highest level, and I am starting to win more often than not.A note: the game seems to give more doubles and favorable rolls to the opponent. The makers assure that the random number generator is really random, and they even offer a roll-your-own option for dice. But doesn't it always seem that you are getting worse rolls when you are losing. (Probably why you are losing).The two player feature would be a good option for plane trips and the like, when you don't want to risk loosing pieces."

Play black or white, inward or outward, with or without doubles, with or without Crawford's rule, 5 levels of AI with fast or slow graphic animations; check game win stats for each AI level and die totals, doubles at the end of each set.User interface is great. There are places it can be tweaked, eg maybe an option to switch sides for Roll and Double.CONS: The appstore does not allow rating this app 6 stars."

If you leave a piece open, 9 times out of 10 the computer will roll exactly what is needed to cover your piece and send you back and the computer rolls an inordinate amount of high doubles, making it tough to beat. At least there is an undo feature so you can change your previous move at times."

You can take your move back even if the computer has already moved. It shows you which pieces are available to move, and where they can move, if you want it to. You can choose single games or matches with or without doubling.You can play against other people if you want to. For advanced players, this would be a convenient way to do that, but advanced players will not be challenged by the solo play. I'm advanced-beginner level and win most games at the highest level."

I keep track of my statistics and do see that the opponent gets more doubles which can be frustrating but since I consistently win more games and matches playing at the 5th level, I have to say that the game is created to let skill trump luck.  It would be a good game for novices to learn the game as well.  It's five levels give people a chance to compete at any level."

There are also options allowing you to choose the difficulty level, and other options.  Highly recommend and it's FREE!"

    "reviewText": "This game has nice graphics, five (supposed) levels of play, and convenient player cues when  making moves.What it does NOT have is an AI which knows anything about basic backgammon strategy. That makes the five levels of difficulty not really be five levels of difficulty, because the game plays the same flawed strategies at each of the five levels.In fact, I've played several computer backgammon games over the last 25 or so years, and this is unquestionably the worst AI I've yet seen.In particular, it doesn't have a clue how to best run to the inner table or how to roll off. Two games in a row when I was hopelessly out-pipped (as the AI had already rolled more doubles than odds make credible) the AI simply chose the least efficient method of filling the inner table and then rolling off. At times it will move up men on the inner table when rolling off instead of taking two men off of lower points.It will \"arrange\" the inner table when there are still men to bring there. In one game at the \"highest\" difficulty, the AI had all but two men in the inner table, and needed 12 pips to bring those to the inner table. I had three men outside the inner table and needed more than 20 pips. On two turns in a row it \"arranged the inner table\" instead of advancing the last two men. In the meantime I brought all three of my men to the inner table, and actually rolled off my first pair before it brought in its last two.In another game both the AI and I had all our men in the inner table, and his array was much more balanced, as I was piled up on 5 and 6. On a few turns the AI moved men up from its 5 and 6 instead of taking men off of 2 and 3. When it later rolled 5s and 6s they were wasted. I won that game without doubles, and I should have needed both double 5s and double 6s to win.This game, as do most computer backgammon games I've played, seems to roll doubles for itself at an unlikely high rate. Also, be prepared that most useful game opening rolls are going to be \"won\" by the AI. LOL But the AI is so clueless that it doesn't really do it any good. Note that the game will also at times accept hopeless doubles, but that is not uncommon for backgammon AIs. The only games it won were games where it considerably out-rolled me, like 40 to 50 pips worth.I played this on a Kindle Fire HD 8.9 without any technical issues.Recommended if you don't want a challenge, otherwise look elsewhere."

However, I was very disappointed to discover after installing it that my stats from 1000+ games played in the free version weren't imported into the paid version, starting me out at ground zero. I know it seems trivial, but in an app where stats are collected it seems almost a given that the stats should carry over when you like an app enough to pay to move from the free version. I've got enough time invested in the free version that in many ways it seems more attractive to put up with the occasional ad and keep my stats than to start over again ad-free. Gotta knock off a star for this oversight.In all other respects, this is a five-star app. If you're not coming from the free version (or don't mind losing your stats if you are), consider this a five-star review and invest (if you missed getting it as the FAOTD) without reservation."

This version of Backgammon plays a good game -- but not the kind where you will be beaten every time you play.  (I hate computer chess games, for example.)  Of course, it's still a game of change; your success depends, to a great extent, on the &#34;roll of the dice&#34; -- literally. But in this case, that roll seems pretty fair.  And with some careful playing, I tend to win more games than I lose -- which is fine with me."

Of course, sometimes I get lucky. I do know enough about backgammon to know that \"luck\" usually favors the better player. Yes, the dice matter, but it is more about what you do with the rolls you get.I find it fascinating to read accusations that the game \"cheats.\" I just played a game where I was way behind and rolled consecutive double 6s to get closer. I still lost, but I thought I would throw out this experience as evidence that the dice can come up with unusual rolls both ways.You just can't go too far wrong with the AI Factory games. I love their backgammon, checkers, and chess. I was thinking about buying this anyway, so I was very glad to get it as the FAOTD."

    "reviewText": "This review is for the free version.  Very nicely done implementation of backgammon, with fast and elegant interface, nice user controls, and good documentation.  I agree with some of the other reviews that the computer opponent seems to follow a flawed strategy with its end game in that it doesn't try to get its pieces off the board as soon as possible.  Also it seems slow to double when the game is winning and quick to accept doubles when I'm winning.  All in all, it's just challenging enough for me to make it interesting at level 5.As for the random dice generator, I don't agree that the computer cheats, but it doesn't seem to have a true uniform distribution (where each of the six sides of each die is equally likely).  In one of my first dozen games it gave me the same roll three turns in a row, and it does seem to roll an awful lot of doubles."

(Anybody else remember using telnet to connect to FIBS?)Well this certainly looks a lot better than the old telnet days. :-)  The board and dice are very nicely designed, both the classic and modern skins. I played a couple games on the different difficulty levels, and I'd say there's enough range that anyone short of a world-class player is going to find a level that is challenging and rewarding.Pros:1. Looks great.2. Free App of the Day3. 5 difficulty levels to choose from. Should be sufficient for anyone from the beginner to the serious player.4. Well worth the 99 cents...but...FREE today!5. Almost no permissions. Other than writing to storage, this thing doesn't try to do anything. I have my WiFi off when testing games, and the Single Player works without a hitch.Cons:I can't think of any.Recommendation:Get it while it's the FAOTD if you can, but if you like backgammon, it's worth the 99 cents if you miss out on the freebie."

    "reviewText": "The dice appear to be driven off a pre-seeded prng, since you can undo multiple rolls and then get exactly the same rolls again. That isn't technically buggy and they can legitimately claim to get a flat distribution over time, but it means players can cheat and therefore so can the computer.Secondly, the AI is defective. It's even worse than one I would write! That really REALLY needs fixing. Badly. It seems to have a lookahead of zero and a penchant for stacking everything on the last space. Either write a better AI (herustics, not fixed moves) or let it write its own (genetic algorithms)."

And not only that, the doubles were the number it could use the most to maximize moves towards a win! I'm sorry to say, but I honestly believe there is a flaw in the game that favors the device when in single player mode. If the rolls were more random, or the gameplay were more 'fair', It would definately get a higher score from me, but not the way it is. Also, one othe thing a LOT OF DEVELOPERS IGNORE ; AN EXIT BUTTON!!!!!!!  I'm not a developer/programmer, but how hard can it be? Too bad about all this, I love Backgammon!I read some of the other reviews and most people (as I do) that the dice are loaded. The roll should be as random as you can possibly make them concidering the limitations of programming. The differences should be where the AI decides to move the game pieces, leaving more open, or not, depending on the level. The dice rolls should ALWAYS BE RANDOM and have the same probability for both players. This would be the way it happens in real life with two people playing a real game. If the game ever gets updated to reflect better play conditions, my rating will go up."

There are times it will hit every possible blot, and then other times, will not hit a blot that would be to it's advantage. The end game is ridiculous. The program wants to want to move all men to the home point FIRST - even if there are men that could be taken off a higher point. Unless I play with the doubling cube, I can easily beat the program 98% of the time at the top level. Graphics are very good, the game keeps better statistics statistics, the available moves are highlighted, and even the sound of the men 'shooshing' as they are moved are all pluses.In comparison to the Compulab game on my Kindle keyboard, no contest!But I wanted Backgammon for the Fire HD.....................Three months later.I am much more satisfied with the HD backgammon at this point. There is the feature that allows you to \"undo\" a move, because the touch screen can be somewhat sensitive. But you can \"undo\" all the way back to the beginning. I'll do that to see if a specific move was where the game fell apart. I still find the end game irritating. The statistics allow you to look at how many spaces could be moved, and the number of doubles in the game. After a total of over 700 games played on all levels, I moved my review up one star to four."

Level of play ranges from easy to medium, if you are professional backgammon player it will probably be too easy for you. It is, however, a good range for most.In terms of permissions, this is another great app by ai factory, which means no spyware and no intrusive permissions. I have purchased several of their apps before and this is no bait and switch, their apps stay permission free"

    "reviewText": "I like the Backgammon app, but there are a few things that are quite annoying.  For example, when you roll doubles, you have no option to move two pieces at a time.  You have to make 4 separate moves, with each move involving at least 2 clicks.  that's 8 clicks for one move, which is too many.  Also, I started playing against the computer, with the difficulty set at 2.  Even though it's not the lowest setting, the computer played like a complete novice, passing up obvious moves in favor of idiotic ones.  Of course, this can be solved by simply setting the game at a higher difficulty, but it was still annoying.  I'll be looking for fixes in updates, so I haven't given up hope that this could become an outstanding app."

It is one of the first things I went looking for when I got my tablet (an archos 70)... but I have not, yet been able to put it on my archos 5 because of lack of market access (I will try downloading to that device later now that Amzon has it, but it works fine on the archos 70!)Writing this review makes me feel old indeed.  I spent so many night awake until all hours of the night playing this on my dad's apple 2c back in 1975,6,7... it is a very rich game and one you will not finish in an hour or a day.  This is the game which spawned an entire genre (or 2 or 3): rpgs, text adventures, d & d sims... they all started here.So far this port seems very true to the original; at least I have not found a place where it deviates (but for the addition of voice control, if that is available/ enabled on your device).  I have not used that component (I would feel very odd sitting in a waiting room, e.g. and talking to my tablet) but the text component is true to the original.Colossal cave takes you on a grand adventure underground: dragons, pirates, and other slithery things :)  I would not want to spoil it for the uninitiated by giving a blow by blow.  I will just say that this is definitely worth downloading!  You can't get much more \"retro,\" as this is the first of its kind.  if you grew up with games which are heavy on the graphics... well you are missing something in terms of engaging your imagination.  Give this a try.  What have you got to lose? (other than hours and hours and hours.... heh heh heh)."

There is a fascination with something that at first appears so simple, yet without \"awesome graphics\" or \"3-D whiz bangs\" or any other \"modern gaming devices\", and is still challenging and enjoyable.The game is implemented well, and I highly recommend it -- especially to younger players (by which I include anyone under about 35!) -- as a wonderful break from the fast and furious trigger-finger mindless destruction games that are so prevalent today."

It's very basic with its vocabulary, but if you can manage to get into it, it's a very enjoyable and very vivid adventure because the graphics are all in your head.  It's one of the best relics of interactive fiction.  Infocom games started out soon after this and are very similar.  It's a lot like Zork I, but a little different."

The app is called calorie counter, but it doesn't count anything. It simply allows you to pick a restaurant, look at a list of menu items, and touch each item to see its nutritional values. No pictures, no way to add up the various items to total up the meal, no way to keep track of your history to try to reduce calorie intake and raise protein intake... nothing particularly useful.This was most disappointing when looking at the list of ingredients at chipotle. It lists out the tortillas, chips, salsa, meat, cheese, beans... etc. But no way to build the burrito or plate to know what you're about to eat. I am not a developer, but there is no way this feature would be difficult to add.Lastly, I should be able to enter my calorie intake goals and be able to see where most of my calories come from. Without this feature, it is just an app full of raw data. I am almost certain that I can find all of this information on a single website if I googled it. I really got my hopes up on this app and I can't believe anyone would pay $3 for this raw and freely available information.This app has potential to be extremely useful. Most of my meals come from local restaurants. Add these features and I might just pull out my phone for something other than words with friends during my meal."

Good idea.The inclusion of some of the chain restaurants that aren't fast food would be very nice. I see applebees is there so it looks to be in the works.A utility in the program to request restaurants to add or even reference sources such as a url or something to make it easier for the dev to find and add more places would be icing on the cake.Cool application.

So there is no report of saturated fat, vitamins, or other useful info. It only displays one item at a time, so adding up a meal would be a very arduous process that would require pen, paper, and probably a calculator.

    "reviewText": "I know this app is called a fast food calorie counter which is sort of misleading since it does not count calories for you, but I think it is still awesome.My wife and I have carried around a little book called the Calorie King which does the same thing but cost $10. While this app does not include certain resteraunts such as Red Robin (as some have complained about) we must keep in mind that this is a Fast Food calorie counter. The fact that places like Bob Evans and Chipotle are even on this list are a bonus.As for the fast food selection, it is darn good. I dont have one fast food place in my area that is not listed. They even go into detail by showing calories for individual condoments!I would have rated this 4 because I too would have liked to see an adding capability within this app but since so many people felt it necessary to give 1's just for missing that small part, I want to give it a 5 to boost up its overall rating because this is not a bad app. Like I said it is competing with calorie look up books that do the same thing for 3 times the price. Normally a great deal but today its a steal!"

    "reviewText": "I read the reviews for this one &amp; figured it would suck, but knowing how unreliable the reviews on here can be, I decided to check it out for myself just to be sure.  Well, they're right on about this one.There's one single good thing about this app, &amp; that's the fact that you can sort a restaurant's menu by calories or fat, or any of the other 5 or so ways they have listed. The only time I eat at any of these places is if I'm with someone else who really wants to eat there. So, if you're like me, this might be useful if you're looking to find the least fattening thing on the menu to eat. Regardless, it won't add up menu items for you, so you're going to be adding it up on your own if you want to know how much your whole meal is worth. This would be especially tedious if you were getting a salad, for example, as the dressing, croutons, etc. are listed separately &amp; would have to be added up separately.  Add the fact that they don't usually have all sizes listed, &amp; this app just becomes basically useless.It's a pain sifting though their lists no matter how you sort them. Not all restaurants are listed. When you find your restaurant, not all items or sizes are included. You can't add up menu items. The list could go on &amp; on. Plain &amp; simple this app sucks. They should be ashamed to charge people for this thing, &amp; I'm almost positive you could find a free one that's much more complete &amp; user friendly. For free it's an incomplete list I still won't waste my phone memory on. If it's a work in progress, then give it for free or don't release it until it's done.Restaurants have dietary info available that you can ask to see, or you can get online &amp; see it. Either way, you'll get a better list than this app gives you. Or, do yourself a favor &amp; don't eat fast food. Once you get used to eating healthy, you don't need a list or a calorie counter to help."

The list of restaurants is extremely short. The app doesn't look like anything special, considering the dev's want money for it. It lacks so many features, features that every other app of this category have. There should be some sense of customizing meals. Even if they didn't go above and beyond, selecting 1 standard size for each item is ridiculous. Some of these fast food sites even let you build your meal and see the totals. Honestly, this is a poor excuse for a calorie counting app. Don't waste your time.Phone: Droid X(Android 2.2.1, Liberty 2.0.1)"

Almost every single one of these restaurants already has this information on their web sites, and most of those allow you to build a meal so that you can actually COUNT calories.This app is also sorely lacking in food and restaurants. The Arby's Angus Three Cheese and Bacon is missing, and I've been seeing commercials for that for several weeks now. Plus the restaurant Zaxby's isn't listed at all.Honestly this would be tolerable were this a free app, it really wouldn't be worth. 99, but frankly for the dev to charge 3 bucks for this is just downright insulting."

I don't like how the advertising is located conveniently too close to the &quot;roll&quot; bar, the dice (as you try to highlight them), and the options tab at the bottom of the screen.  I have accidentally hit the ad countless times and had to back out numerous. times in the middle of a game.  (KFire)  I also dislike that extra 5 of a kind cannot be counted as a score for a full house.iI give it 2 stars because the actual gameplay is pretty quick.Going to uninstall to see if I can't find one I like better,  or at least one that doesn't have gameplay functions literally on top of ad links.  I got a FAR better Yahtzi game on a CD out of a cereal box!"

Works great on the Kindle Fire, I've had no problems with the app.  I wish it had multi player capability but my wife plays it on her Fire and I play on mine and we compare scores.  I like the features of being able to move an item places in case you tap the wrong field.  The color change in the options is nice but it will sometime revert back to the original color then change to the color scheme you selected.Overall it's a fun app if you like playing Yahtzee."

I can whip out game after game, but it takes away from enjoyment. It's a good game to play if you are just trying to pass a few minutes of time. Glad it was free."

Obviously the developer was worried that the app wouldn't pass Amazon's reviewers, since it looks like the developer really wants your phone info (why? To sell, would be my guess). So you download this app and soon after you are alerted that there is an update. Of course, the update might be a great way to revert the app to the original permissions that were specified in the Market version.Guess what happens when you update the app."

    "reviewText": "To those concerned about downloading apps and becoming victims of data mining businesses, I've listed what this developer was asking for on Market vs. the \"dog and pony show version\" you're now downloading on Amazon (THAT WILL SURELY BE UPDATED sometime after FAOTD when the developer feels you've already trusted his app, are not paying close attention, and are \"simply updating\" for some other minor bug fix).Permisssions the developer submitted in his AMAZON FAOTD version:(the version you are considering downloading... for NOW)* Read only access to phone state.* Write to external storage.* Open network sockets.* Access information about Wi-Fi networks.* Access the vibration feature.* Access information about networks.The STANDARD permissions the developer currently asks for in his MARKET version:(NOTE: for both PAID & FREE Market versions identical, and only FREE version has \"ads\")* Network communication - full Internet access - Allows an application to create network sockets.* Phone calls - read phone state and identity - Allows the application to access the phone features of thedevice. An application with this permission can determine the phone number and serial number of thisphone, whether a call is active, the number that call is conncted to and the like.* Storage - modify/delete USB storage contents modify/delete SD card contents - Allows an application towrite to the USB storage. Allows an application to write to the SD card.* Hardware controls - control vibrator - Allows the application to control the vibrator.* Network communication - view network state - Allows an application to view the state of all networks.* view Wi-Fi state - Allows an application to view the information about the state of Wi-Fi. (network comm.)Anyone who looks at the Market versions can clearly see those permissions are way out of wack to run a \"car version\" of the Block Me game, especially the Market's PAID version.  The developer wants ALL those permissions in BOTH free and paid versions, so in the paid version, you're paying for \"more game\" and not \"less/no ads.\"  The developer clearly doesn't care about giving you more \"game\" for the money, because he has no intention of changing the unbelievably invasive permissions that are the poster child for data mining.Now the developer faces Amazon.  He knows asking for your phone's ID and serial number and a list of all the numbers of who you call, and who called you, are going to pop right out to Amazon reviewers as the BIG CLUE that he is data mining.  So he takes it out.... but he leaves in the others and hopes those permissions gets defended as necessary for that wonderful \"leaderboard action\" and \"rate this app\" and \"notify me of bugs\" stuff, as so many unknowing Amazon reviewers DO have a habit of doing to justify keeping the free app they don't want to part with.READ THE PERMISSIONS YOURSELF and YOU decide how the developer makes a living off this app, what he did to get onto Amazon FAOTD, what all those permissions on the Amazon version add up to (even WITHOUT the phone serial number request), why phone information is wanted by the developer on all other versions but this Amazon one (for now), and what he'll likely do to update YOUR app once he's out of the Amazon spotlight.If you doubt the developer will add the phone stuff back, just go right here on Amazon and look at any of the other 16 apps this developer put out here, for instance the \"paid\" version of Bubble Popper.  The permission for the phone is IN there, even in that PAID version.P.S.  Misspellings in an app itself realllllllly get me nervous as to who is developing these apps and why, especially considering the massive phone ID serial numbers theft originating from Asia. Why they can't get or don't want an English-speaking American to look it over first before marketing to America makes me cock my eyebrow in a BIG way."

I played for over an hour and I really thought this game concept was unique and fun to play. It reminds me of being trapped in Manhattan in grid lock and trying to get to the airport to catch a flight.Based on game play it is a 5 star rating, based on violating my privacy is should be a Zero star rating!Now the bad part, why does a simple game app need access to my Kindle Fire data?  Here are the permissions that it asks for access to:* Storage (OK)* Network Communication (not OK)* Kindle calls for Kindle state and Identity (not OK)* View network state (not OK)* View WIFI state (not OK)* Hardware controls to control vibrator (OK)There is no good reason why any app needs my Kindle state and ID.  This is another app that either collects the data for themselves or for the tooling software company who developed the app development software.Such programs are under investigation now by 35 State Attorneys General who are asking the five major app selling distributors (Including Amazon) to require the app developers to disclose their privacy policies before their services are installed on a device.  At question is the ability to pull sensitive information from your device and use it themselves or resell it to other companies.Most app developers have not even drawn up privacy policies as they believe that they are outside of a 7 year old law governing online privacy.  Such apps can drill into your address books and other personal files on smart phones and tablets.  The states feel that most people rightfully do not want that to happen and don't even know that it is going on inside of their device.The Federal Trade Commission has released a study that indicates that the app makers are collecting data even about children and violating federal laws.The answer is not a 10 page publication regarding the app makers privacy policy, the answer is simply, \"DO NOT COLLECT MY PRIVATE DATA FOR ANY REASON!\"  Writing a privacy policy may make some app makers think twice about misusing data but how will that protect the consumer when the app developer is overseas and out of reach of the federal and state laws and jurisdictions?For the above mentioned reasons I give this app 1 star as that is the lowest I can go.  Please stop putting data collection software onto my personal and private devices!"

No? Maybe if you are God. This seems to be a puzzle game for God, as it is nothing we humans can relate to.Would be better if it were a bit more realistic and put blocks or a host of other things than cars.If you are God and can relate to this, then its not a bad game, but very simple and has no depth. Special abilities, new mechanics, etc."

I understand keeping it simple, but options such as volume on/off, difficulty level, etc would be nice. Too easy for older kids, too hard for younger, fits a very narrow age and skill range.With a little refining this app would be worth purchasing. Until then it is a honestly a little expensive.3 stars for current version and price4 stars if price drops to $0.99 or app is updated."

    "summary": "OK for a 2 yo.. maybe 3",
    "reviewText": "This program consists of about six single-screen puzzles, each with a few variations.  After about 10 minutes of play they begin to repeat.  As you move through the games there is no escalation in difficulty or any apparent attempt to select the \"next\" puzzle based on previous puzzles or the child's success at solving them.In our case my 4-year old daughter got bored even before the first sequence was completed.  A little ways after the puzzles began to repeat she closed the app and wanted to watch a movie.On the plus side, this app is \"solid\" (no bugs and with a finished appearance).  It also does *not* need any kind of Internet connection to run.  (Some reviewers said it did and I expect they may have been using an earlier version.)  Finally, it runs just fine on my Samsung Galaxy 10.1 tablet.In summary, it is good for at least one fairly short sitting."

Also, it turns off your screen saver as well as your ability to exit the app, so the only way to stop it is to turn off the phone, turn the phone back on, and then kill it, so it's murder on your battery life."

There are different activities, yes, simple puzzle, colors,  letters and a few more - however you cannot pick what you want to play as they are randomly set up and delivered in groups of 5-6 games or so per round of play -after each round you get a little sticker to place on a board - stickers are cute and fun idea - however they are not saved (no option)  and you start with blank board each time you begin play --would have been better if u could keep the stickers in a little album or something. - After about 5 rounds of playing I noticed games were repeating,  after about 10 rounds my daughter noticed - just not enough variety or options for a paid app - or an app for kiddos with minimal attention spans!!! I use on Kindle Fire and as with other reviews I read I do not have to be connected to Wifi to play- can play in car, on the go no prob."

Either way, ask your friends about personal ouija board experiences. Using Ouija boards have been reported to cause anything from hauntings to possesion, and honestly what is a ouija board but cardboard with numbers and letters drawn on it? My point is, using things for the intent of talking to otherworldly creatures might bring trouble your way...especialy on a computer program like this. Also, the battery life issues are probably just the program using alot of power, but ghosts reportedly drain battery power, so it could be a sign of true activity if the power gets low while getting accurate word hits."

I had just gotten out of the shower, talking to my husband, naked I might add, and the word \"Beautiful\" came up. Now I could flatter myself and think it was talking about me but I just brushed it off then I had to give my husband Insulin, 2 shots which he doesn't like very well and was grumbly about it, when I was through I looked at my Kindle and another word popped up, \"Necessary\" Coincidence? I don't know but it is very entertaining and I would recommend it for entertainment purposes."

And sometimes it'll say random things like 'kite' and 'child' when neither of those things are around. so I'm skeptical as to whether or not this is real or for just entertainment purposes...nonetheless, it's creepy when it's accurate."

I thought it was cool, but come on, there are pots everywhere! either in your yard or somewhere else, you can always find something common with the random word that appears on the radar. Its a cool app, but in my opinion, they just choose a buncha random words that make you think this app can &quot;detect &quot; stuff when your fooling yourself out. I was using it this morning on my bed and it was like &quot;can, winter, principal &quot;?! Wtf, am I in school or something? lol but this app is worth the download even though it might be fake."

I quickly got bored with it and deleted it. Afterwards, I was persuaded to actually BUYING the other version of Ghost Radar, which was supposedly &quot;better.&quot; Sure, it was a little cooler. You could go back and forth from the classic radar and an activity waves line graph. It also &quot;translated the ghosts messages to you,&quot; which I actually believed for a while. But don't believe a word of it, people. The radar does not &quot;sense&quot; anything. If you want an app that you can just use for fun, go ahead. But it does NOT sense ghosts. Just saying whaylt your gut is screaming."

Maybe they thought people would get their moneys worth that way to give people who paid for it more fake excitement? It seems that way to me.If you're into the paranormal, I would download the free version just if you're curious but don't buy the paid version. The free version is better, in my opinion.Don't expect this to be a serious tool--it's just a toy."

This application does an adequate job of finding the big pieces like my legs but isn't sensitive enough for my fingers and nose.

(Which I assume were ghosts)?Then my phone starts popping off word after word. Are these ghosts having a conversation? It seemed like all nonsensical words. Well after a couple of minutes of this I said aloud, \"Go away ghosts, I'm trying to work here!\"Suddenly the radar went blank and for the next 20 minutes not another word came out of my phone. I finished my work and turned the app off.Freaky Man!"

Not much happened after that so I figured it needed movement so I started shaking it. Soon words came popping out but I froze when the word brother came up. The next word was beside. I kid you not!

The family would sometimes find the front door mysteriously  ajar.  And sometimes they would hear mysterious thumping sounds from somewhere down the hallway, around where their teenager's.bedroom is.This app made it possible to finally detect these poltergeists!  After carefully using this app, focusing all my attention on the device for only 3 hours, I was able to see, for just a moment, what would otherwise look like a piece of dust floating.  Of course, since I was using the Ghost Radar app, I was confident that this could be no piece of dust - I had spotted, if only for a split second, the guilty poltergeist!I'm only giving this game 4 stars out of 5 because it doesn't tell you the next step.  In other words, how do I now get rid of the poltergeists?C'mon, developers, get with the program!"

If you already have your mind made up then you're wasting your time. What freaked me out were the words the thing said. I always dismiss things when possible or discount them as coincidence,but enough coincidence equals an affirmation. Not there yet,but this is still interesting. The first word it said was &quot;lying &quot; which is exactly what was on my mind about a friend. Then it said a name of a friend of mine. It said the name of another friend,his Dads name,and then his cats name. Then it said &quot;sing &quot; which is an inside joke between us. Of course it's more than likely coincidence,but it still gave me a slight freakout. Now if I talk to my freinds tomorrow and they happened to be thinking about me when the words were spoken.... that's what would freak me the frak out. Interesting app allegedly fake or not. What harm does an open mind have?"

It randomly says a word in an electronic voice and saves it in a list. The radar spins and it shows you the presence of spirits nearby.Main screen:* VOX* Radar a series of red, blue and green dots appear and disappear from the screen supposedly indicating the presence of ghosts* Words - captures a list of random words that supposedly were spoken by a ghost.* Stop radar - stops radar from spinning* Settings - adjust sensitivity of the device from low, med, high and advanced.* Advanced - allows you the ability to adjust the sensitivity of your device's sensors. This includes Scan frequency, duplicate detection threshold, display impedance, signal timeout and signal capacitance.What I like:It was free!What I don't like:The waste of time to download this app and looking at the screen. Unless these ghosts are speaking via WIFI my Kindle Fire won't hear them as the Kindle Fire does not have a microphone. Just about the only way the Kindle Fire would convince me that it detected a ghost is if it flew out of my hands and hit me in the head.Summary:This app is a complete time waster and a waste of battery power. If it is an electronic Ouija Board it is slow, boring and useless. In an hour it heard 9 words that absolutely make no sense. They were: motor, this, sugar, safety, whether, frozen, creature, muscle and soap. Unless the spirit drove their car into a frozen lake because of eating too much sugar and was attacked by a creature with a muscle cramp and covered with soap then I don't know what this means?This app is just silliness and not worth the time to download. If you like such things you might enjoy it but I won't waste the batteries on my tablet for this app. The only thing recently appearing and disappearing in my house is this app.Size: this app is 3.29MB on my Kindle Fire.Permissions:System tools - modify global system settings"

    "reviewText": "One might find theGhost Radar: LEGACYapp to be humorous, and some may find it silly, but whatever your choice is, it's a fun addition to the Kindle Fire. It claims to detect and track paranormal activity that happens to be nearby, and to be able to measure local electromagnetic energies, vibrations and sounds.Who am I to argue with this?This app takes up just 2.8MB on your Kindle Fire or other Android devices, and once you've downloaded it, you'll be able to customize its interface to meet your own personal paranormal inquisitiveness. You can adjust its sensitivity to adjust for background noise, and toggle between its numerical & graphical interface. And if you're taking your Kindle Fire into a serious business meeting, you can stop it before your boss thinks that you're a bit loopy.But if you take it into a Starbucks or similar coffee shops during that caffeine break, just watch what happens.For those interested in supposed paranormal activity, there are other apps available out there to add to your ghost-busting arsenal. There'sEMF Sensor, but that won't work on a Kindle Fire because this device lacks a magnetic field sensor which is necessary to display any data. There'sGhost Detectorand even anAny Detector, but read the reviews and specs before you buy any of these.ThisGhost Radar: LEGACYmay fit all of your ghost-busting needs and satisfy your curiosity about paranormal activity that may or may not be present. In any case, it's a lot more fun than some of those games likeAngry WeaselsorScary Gerbilsthat seventeen or more other people in your near vicinity may be playing.But if the word \"Observe\" pops up, you better pay attention...10/25/2012"

I was goofing around with it with my teen son, and I pretended I was mad at him and yelled, and the words came back with, \"She\" and then a second later \"Mad\".Everyone in the room laughed and thought it was funny. When we use it here in the house, we get a few green and yellow and red blips from time to time, but nothing major. So we decided to take it to Galveston, Texas, the third most haunted city in the United States (according to some sources), and we ended up not getting a single blip at all in the Strand District, where hundreds of people were supposed to have died in the hurricane years and years ago. But when we used it in the Walmart parking lot, we got several blips and some words that were people's names: Tim, David, Bill.So, okay, if you're willing to make fun of things and not take this seriously, it's great entertainment, and my teen son loves it. Otherwise, it's just a silly little game that is great for sparking conversation or playing with at parties or get-togethers."

The app just does that beautifully and deserves the applause and rating. The APP worked just fine on my Galaxy tab 10.1 and as that device has more sensors compared to my original Kindle fire which has almost zero sensors I have limited capablity to finding one - Does tilt sensor count? for ghost detection? :DThe APP definitely has some fun in the package and while we all know that there is nothing like ghosts which can be detected by an Android app the fact that the developer did a good job on developing this app deserves a 4 star rating for the sheer fun you can have with the app.Happy Halloween!"

Therefore, I am giving it 2 stars just because it gets people wanting to discuss their app purchases on Amazon."

The game runs very stable and smoothly."

Simple in over all design, your job is to keep track of the various wants of the customers, sending them to the appropriate place as quickly as possible.  The fast you cue them up, the higher your score.  Each level adds complexity with new activities, faster influx of customers, and multiple wants.  Thrown in there is the customer whose needs change part way through (gotta potty!)  Control is simple, just point to select the customer and then where they are to go.  As easy as that sounds, I found that often my input was missed, or selected the wrong item/customer due to multiple objects being close to one another.  The game starts off slow but pick up speed pretty quick.  Graphics are ok, nothing fabulous, but the whole thing works well.  The animations of the customers doing the many activities is funny, though watching them too long can cost you some points.  Sound and music match the graphics, tying the whole game together."

The fact that it only works in portrait mode, does not support partial shares, and does not display after-hours trading data, have caused me to rate it lower than I otherwise would have.On the other hand, the news and market sections are well thought out, and it seems to be stable (I have yet to experience a crash, though I haven't been using it for very long).It is worth noting -- for those that might not be suspecting it -- that the app is add supported, however, the adds have not been intrusive in my experience, and (since the app was free) this did not affect my rating.Overall, it's a good app, however, it is missing several crucial features.Pros:-- News section easy to browse, and grouped by appropriate categories which can be turned on and off.-- Market data is well laid out, grouped by category, then by geographic area with icons representing the industry, or nationality of the security.-- Includes currencies, bonds, and futures which are commonly left out by other financial apps.-- Does not require excessive permissions on your Android device (only needs network information and the ability to create sockets).Cons:-- No partial shares.-- Only works in portrait mode.-- Font size can not be adjusted.-- No after hours trading data."

Ever. Seriously. (Yes, I mean YOU Pohanka Hyundai) In fact, I can't recall ever actually seeing an in-app advertisement that made me want to buy whatever product they were selling, but I can think of dozens of apps I've looked at and then removed because they were ad based. Most such ads are poorly done, difficult to actually read on such a small screen, and block portions of the app you're trying to use, and that's exactly the case with this app. Sorry, that makes this app worth, maximum, 3 stars to me. But offer an ad-free version and I'll gladly rate it 5 stars. Thumbs up if you agree."

I did take my tablet with me in the car the other night to where I had no wi-fi signal and as we drove around I was able to find signals at various houses. This will be handy because so many of my apps don't work outside my home as I have no data plan, only a wi-fi signal within our home, unless I go to the library. Good app, and am glad I put it on my Kindle."

Maybe that was going to be for this offering of an WiFi analyzer from this company. Test and use over time will tell, if this app is worth keeping on the Kindle Fire HD Tablet.

It turned out my signal was a little weak at that end of the house. By simply raising the router to eye-level in the room where it is installed I increased the signal substantially. I've also used this to find and measure open WiFi networks accessible on my Kindle from parking lots where I was waiting for my wife to finish shopping. It's a useful and interesting tool.

    "reviewText": "I liked this WiFi Analyzer app alot early on giving it four stars for its 2.4G wireless graphing. But I have lowered my rating to 2 stars, because of a problem on its 5G coverage---the 5G channel 165 is missing! [I might have to raise it back though, if my Kindle Fire HD 8.9\" is the real problem.]At our home to improve signal quality and throughput I have switched everything to run on 5G directly or through ethernet connections to 5G-extenders. Then it was when I discovered this missing channel problem. On my computer using the program InSSIDer 4, I clearly see three signals. One emanates from my main router and two come from our two Roku 3 units. [After e-mails with the Roku people and experimentation it appears that the Roku-3 remote works either on a separate 5G (access point) signal if the Roku-3 is ethernet connected or over the users 5G wireless if it is wirelessly connected]. In our case the two Roku-3's have found channels 149 and 165 over which to operate, while our router operates over 5G signal on channel 157.With WiFi Analyzer, if one finds the hidden box near the upper left of the graph, just below the icon, it reveals the signal one is using as a box for a 2.4 or 5G signal label. Clicking that switches bands. On my Kindle Fire HD 8.9\" a strong signal seen with InSSIDer 4 on my computer with both computer and the Kindle Fire HD 8.9\" fire physically essentially at the same location, that signal at ch 165 is completely missing. While I honestly don't yet know whether the problem involves this app or some hidden flaw in the Kindle Fire HD wireless range, clearly something is wrong that wireless channel 165 signal is missing using the Kindle Fire HD 8.9\".Can anyone else duplicate the missing channel 165 problem with their Kindle Fire HD 8.9\" or any other device, so as to identify what might be this problem?The above said, perhaps I should raise my rating a bit, because the otherwise similar \"Amped wireless\" Wi-Fi Analytics Tool cannot display my 5G band signals at all. Strangely though it actually reports my ch 157 5G signal and my 149 ch 5G Roku in its listings, just not the ch 165 Roku, making one wonder if my Kindle Fire HD 8.9\" is the real problem. I guess time might answer this problem?"

In Method 2 &#62;&#62; Setup via Web Browser in Step 3 you are directed to a web site to complete the process. That web site is for sale. The Tech Support number takes you to China and while they were helpful in getting me set up, they are more demanding and fast paced than I prefer.If your router has a WPS button to connect devices to your network this is a good device at a good price."

This type of program just gives you a better view of what Wi-Fi's are around, and also more entertaining than what is on your Android device, but usually of not serious use, so what I like about this one, is that it can be moved to the SD card, and it does work on the Froyo version (and later) versions of Android.  This way I do have an entertaining informative app that isn't taking up valuable space."

One display provided by this app can let you know part of why that might be happening; the scan of and display of the wifi channels it sees within range of your device.  You may find, as I did, that your neighbors added a bunch of wireless routers and guess what?  They're all on channel one (1)!  Even out in the woods where I live this can spell trouble.  At the very least you're likely to find that all of them seen within range of home are jammed in the first three or four channels (of the 14 available in the lower frequency band of 2.4GHZ and NONE are on the 5GHZ band).  Putting your own router up on one of those unused channels could be a simple way of avoiding interference and dropouts, etc.  A useful tool to have around on any handheld device for sure."

They're not gonna make a whole other game that like, 10% of Americans would buy because they're colorblind. Also, if you're colorblind and you bought a Kindle Fire, if you have any sense to think ahead, you wouldn't have gotten one for apps, because most apps have color in them.

    "reviewText": "Test devices:Samsung Epic, Android 2.2 officialViewsonic gTablet, Calkulin+Clemsyn 1.5ghz Froyo Combo V6Dragon Fire is a easy to play game where you redirect colored fire from into the appropriate receiver. Graphically, it's ok, and scaled all the way up to use the full 10\" screen of the gTablet. The background music is decent, adding to the ambiance of the game rather than detracting from it. Control is done through tapping the connectors to change the direction the fire will travel along. It sounds pretty simple, and it is, but each new level adds complexity. More colors, more connectors, more receivers, etc. The difficulty level selection is done by adjusting the speed of the game. I like the way they do this, which is with a slide bar instead of a few predefined speeds. Dragon Fire lacks a score mechanism or any other way of tracking how well you did other than by completing the level. If there is such a thing in the game, I missed it, and there isn't a help section to clarify things. The base game is good, but the app as a whole lacks depth found in similar games.I hope you found this review helpful, and if not, feel free to leave comments/questions."

I am not a techie person by nature, so I had assumed they would be updating me automatically. Or at least sending me the information if there was a critical upgrade.

    "reviewText": "I've used SplashId for several years on Palm, Windows Mobile and Windows desktop. It has been easy to use. Synchronizing between platforms has been good but not perfect. Version 6 wireless synchronous works very well, better than previous versions.The interface in this version takes some time to learn but is pretty good. After using version 4 for a few years, I've had difficulty finding some functions and features but no serious issues.The big problem with this version is that the App locks every time I switch to another App. I open SplashID Safe,  enter the password, get a password for a web site, switch to the browser and then return to SplashID only to find I must enter the password again even if only a few seconds passed since I entered it.SplashData tech support says the lockout delay was removed for security reasons. They are working on a solution to add the lockout delay back into the App. The Aneroid App is practically useless to me if this defect is not corrected."

The accompanying data is interesting for anyone who might need it.  The ability to use this as live wallpaper is a nice touch.CONS: As live wallpaper, the changes are (obviously) gradual.  For all the memory and CPU live wallpaper consumes, it would be nice to see something happening.  Despite all the PROS, this is not an app I think anyone would use every day, or even very often, and probably wouldn't be left on one's phone/tablet for very long.  Of course, as previously mentioned, the app asks for far too many permissions for what it does.BOTTOM LINE: This app falls into my category of \"very cool / not useful\".  What it does, it does well; however, what it does isn't useful enough to me to warrant a permanent place on my phone or tablet.  I installed it, played with it for 20 minutes, got bored, and uninstalled it.Nevertheless, kudos to the developer for putting together a nice app.  Interested to see what's next."

My father even had a garden competition with his father to try to prove this was wrong.  His garden looked great.  Bushy, leafy. Healthy. But not much crop.  His dad's garden looked punier but bore like crazy--an abundance of green beans, great looking corn, cucumbers, tomatoes.  The fact that planting by the phases of the moon might have that kind of effect fascinates me.  And being only a so-so gardener, I can use all the help God can give.  This was a Christmas freebie.  It offers information on moon phases.  Garden season is approaching.  Here's hoping this helps!"

It even has some other features such as a calendar to show what phase of Moon will be in on a particular day of the month.There are a few things that were a little rough around the edges. This program can be moved to the SD card. This is a very important feature, since most of my tablets are of the older variety and is good to make room on the main flash drive. The first time I ran this program on the card, it really didn't want to work. But that was the only time that it complained. It has fired up correctly since then. It does not show correctly what part of the moon is lit up, though the amount that seem to be correct.So, it is something to play around with, and doesn't take any space on the main memory."

Oddly enough, the story is what kept me playing through all 100 levels.  The lack of an ending to that story is the only reason I dock this game a star."

The only issue I have is that as the level changes, it's not always intuitive what you should do, so there's trial and error involved, but even that is pretty fun. We both really enjoy this game."

It's basically a matching game that gets harder as you move along. Kills time but I've played better. And the totem that &quot;talks&quot; to you is neither creepy or cute is straight annoying."

It installed fine on the original 'Kindle Fire' even-though it says \"HD\" and I am keeping this on my Kindle Fire and play few more levels and update the review later if needed.

I've gone under $1,000 twice completing only two games.  It feels like the cards are dealt to frustrate the player. I'm tired of seeing four 4s or three 10s with no place to put them.  With the other Vegas-style Klondike solitaire game with nice cards that I like [Solitaire (free)], my balance after a load of games is -$5, which feels better.  Maybe Klondike more realistically reflects what would happen to me at a casino, but it isn't fun for me.  I'll stick with Solitaire (free).--------------------------------------There are two things I ask of a Klondike-type of solitaire program--Vegas scoring rules and a deck of cards that is easy to read.  Most (but not all!) programs have Vegas scoring, but very few have visually appealing cards.  They are invariably, crude, fuzzy, or just plain unpleasant to look at.  Klondike Solitaire is one of two apps of the nearly dozen I've looked at that satisfy both of my criteria.  The other is Solitaire (Free).  Unfortunately, Amazon system won't let me insert a link to the Amazon page for the other app, but you can find it by using Amazon's search feature."

On top of all of that you (the developer) should probably remove the base picture after the zombie one is made. you move too far to one side or the other and you can clearly see the picture used. It's a good concept, but needs a LOT of work."

I've tried a number of different Twitter clients for my Android phone and tablet, and Seesmic was the one I kept coming back to. The timeline is smooth and simple to navigate, managing direct messages and @ mentions is quite convenient, and searching across Twitter is dead simple. It's been over a year now since the folks behind HootSuite acquired Seesmic, but the Seesmic app has (so far) not been effected by that. If you're looking for the solution for using Twitter on your Android device, Seesmic is it."

You can add/edit single cards in your existing sets fairly easily too, but...Deleting might become a chore if you've got a lots of cards in one set - currently, as far as I can tell, you can only delete ALL of your existing decks, the current card you're on, or you can \"go to\" a card number - It would be much nicer if you could scroll through a list of your cards by content (instead of the \"go to\"), and/or if you could delete a specific selected deck.There is a decent selection of fonts and font sizes available. Background can be switched from lined to plain paper - though it would be good if you could change the background color to something other than white...When you run through a stack of cards, the app uses a \"pass/no pass system\" i.e., you can flag the ones you are having trouble with, and then just review those specific cards when you are finished. You can also shuffle the cards.Well worth a buck for my purposes."

Before someone tells me I AM an idiot I do like the app, but I will admit that I feel like my issues are more &#34;user errors&#34; than an issue w/ the app itself, I just got my kindle for Christmas and I'm constantly learning new things about how to do something. But all-in-all I'd recommend it. I'm in college, a senior, and I really benefit from using flashcards, and this is a much easier system than writing out hundreds of notecards and trying to keep them all organized, together but separated from other classes notecards. So I'm hoping this kindle/e-flashcards will be just as beneficial to my learning style as hand written cards are."

I'm a newbie to freecell, but I finally solved my first one after about half a dozen previous attempts.Couple suggestions: allow undo's all the way back to the initial state (currently, I think the undo's are limited to 10 or so ?). Secondly, allow user to move a card from the Aces area back to the tableau -- currently, I think once you stack a card onto one of the aces stacks, it won't let you move it back to the tableau.  These two features are absolutely critical when you need to backtrack in order to find the solution.  When these two issues are resolved, combined with the killer graphics, this will be the app of choice for playing FreeCell."

This may be perfect for some people, but I have become increasingly accustomed to games that offer a variety of different backgrounds and other rewards; I tend to be ambivalent about the rash of games that don't have these things, despite the capabilities to make them. I think one redeeming point here is the \"hidden words\" section -- but that's about it. By my third play, I was a bit tired of testing the limits of my vocabulary in the way this game wants me to."

    "reviewText": "I love Scrabble type games, but it took a while for me to find an app that would let me play a Scrabble-like game in solitaire mode (Lexulous and Words With Friends seem too).  In the mean time I tried the free version of this game.The idea is similar to Scrabble in that you have a rack of tiles that you make words out of.  You can throw in tiles and get them replaced, etc.  That's where the similarity disappears.  You do not connect words, you just make words with what you have.It is a very fast paced game.  If you are a slow player, games will be very short.  You have to make words fast to keep the timer going, and even then, if you only make short words, the game time is very slow.  You have to make long words rapidly to keep going.Apparently some people can do this ad infinitum and have games that never end.  I don't know how to keep a life and get that good.  I feel the timers are far too fast for \"normal\" people.  I'm a pretty good Scrabble player, but it is hard to feel I have not hit a wall after only a few weeks of play.  When you feel you have hit a wall like that, it is hard to want to play.  That's what happened to me.I found you must read the manual to figure out some of what is going on.  My wife is also a good Scrabble player, but she has yet to come close to my \"wall\".  The things you have to do to keep the time from running out just do not work well for some Scrabble players.The idea behind lengthy game play and high scores is that you must never make mistakes, and you must make words more than three letters long.  Not making mistakes on a phone touchscreen keyboard is pretty hard... mistakes being as simple as accidentally trading in a letter because the X button is so stinking close to the letter you want to play that you sometimes hit it.  A word game should not make it necessary for you to have to have surgical precision when you use a touch screen - especially not when the app requires speed.  This is the game's Achille's heel if you ask me.  The user interface is poor considering what you have to do to excel at the game.  The user interface should help you, not hinder you.My tablet has a 4.3\" screen.  I hated the game until I started playing with a stylus.  Even with the stylus the user interface issues are significant.  I cannot imagine playing this on a smaller screen.  The app runs only in portrait mode.  In some ways it seems good, but it is ironic that the vertical spacing is the primary issue with there not being enough space between the letter and the discard icon.  There is so much wasted space that this is totally unnecessary.I love the game but I cannot give it a 5 because the user interface and game design are immature.  The game does not help you want to keep playing it, or rather, does not facilitate it.  It is also a game that is great as long as you fit some kind of high-speed, precision profile, but if you are someone that enjoys word games to grow vocabulary, etc., this is not for you.  Speed and precision are paramount.  This almost seems to counter the ideas behind word games.There is an interesting back story so to speak.  The game has a built in list of hidden words.  If you happen to make that word, it uncovers it.  The idea is that it should help you want to keep playing and trying out more words.  It's a weird feature with promise.  The problem:  uncovering the hidden words is simply a matter of dumb luck.  Dumb luck and words games just don't mix if you ask me.There are also achievements that you can win.  Some of them have names that might be construed to be helpful in giving you an idea what you might have to do to get the achievement.  The problem is, most of them don't, so again, you have this bizarre goal that should make you want to play more, but there it is completely non-obvious what you have to do to gain the achievement.  Maybe it is buried in help?  I don't know, but you really should not _have_ to read the manual to get an idea how to enjoy a game like this.  The game should be able to lead you into good play habits, etc.If you play the free version, bear in mind all your efforts to load up the high score lists are in vain when you transition to the paid version.  Way to go.  Penalize the player for buying the app.  This is the typical feeling I get from this app.  The game goals that should encourage re-play and the implementation seem contradictory.  The implementation seems to be such that you have to have iron will to want to play more than a few times.  Games aren't something I generally want to have to have iron will about.  The game should make me want to play because it is so engaging.In the end, I still have the app on my tablet... but maybe not for long.  I am space constrained, so keeping good apps on there will come down to whether or not the game is something I want to play over and over.  I don't think this game has that now for the \"average\" or even for the \"reasonably expert\" word gamer."

Just one side up to bat.If this was longer, I'd give it 5/5. But I would expect to only devote an hour or less to play the whole game. Just as long as you realize that, you won't be disappointed."

It would have been great if the character found one of Grandpa's time travel devices and we had to travel through time to find and help him."

Nice graphics.The only drawback (4 stars instead of 5) was the game was rather short.This game is fun, clever, and challenging. If you're looking for a puzzle adventure game that you can spend two or three hours playing, I highly recommend this game. I paid $0.99 at the time of this review and I think the game was worth it. I sat with my wife and son and we enjoyed  it together!"

    "reviewText": "Grisly is an old school point and click adventure with high quality graphics and fun, challenging puzzles. Like all point and clicks it suffers from repetition and the sense that all you are doing is going back and forth, room to room to re-click things now that you have the key and so on. Grisly also suffers from small screens and big fingers when it comes to finding stuff. On many screens you can just push everywhere until things pop up. Not much different than moving your mouse around the monitor till your arrow turns to a hand.Overall, Grisly is a fun diversion and a neat trip back in time to old school games. It is easily one of the better looking and functioning games I've played so far. Fans of the genre should pick this one up. If you don't like point and click, don't mark the game down, just don't get it.Worth the cost."

    "reviewText": "There was an update for this app today and they appear to have fixed the Force Close issue that was plaguing the Xoom and the Evo (and possibly other devices).  I am revising my review from 1 star to 4.The game is a point-and-click style adventure in the vein of Indiana Jones and the Fate of Atlantis or Maniac Mansion.  You explore the manor, picking up assorted objects and clues to solve various puzzles.  These puzzles can open new rooms or provide pieces to still other puzzles.The game took me about 1 hour to finish, though this sort of game is old-hat for me.  Some of the puzzles were quite difficult, particularly figuring out the proper color sequence (if you play the game, you'll know what I mean).  Unfortunately, the game doesn't appear to have much replayability, since the puzzles are always the same.Is the game worth $1.99?  I'm not sure.  I got an hour's worth of brain-wracking enjoyment out of it.  That's slightly more per hour than a DVD rental, but cheaper than theatre or movie tickets.Old review:1 starForce closes immediately on my Motorola Xoom. And from reading other reviews, it appears the Xoom isn't the only device having this issue. Glad it was free."

It's very similar adventure game, and keeps you frustrated/ interested to figure out and solve the puzzles in the game.It is only \"very short\" if you know what to do without exploring. Decently long, but not quite as long as a similar full PC game.Some things that I felt were not well designed (but may have fit in with the vision of \"just click everything!\" -*There is a corridor on the second floor between the other doors- you have to click in the middle of the wall, and find there is another door.*They used four birds, and four colors on the globe, but needing to be arranged in a direction, corresponding to the drawing on the second floor. Confusing since the colors on the globe seem to have the same directions of the drawing, and not the \"statues\"* in the main hallway both the floor and the \"paper\" on the painting aren't visibly \"interactive\".Overall a fun game, and most of the puzzles are fun to figure out. Graphics are great, the only real complaints are the issues with the game design, and possibly wanting more to the story - but it is after all a puzzle game, and not needing a \"cool story\"."

    "reviewText": "This game is very reminiscent of games like the Myst series, 7th Guest and 11th Hour.  Its a bit quirky and the storyline is a bit obtuse which leaves one with a very loose idea of where to look next in some areas.  In games like this the fun is all in the delivery, the story unfolding.  Unfortunately thats where this one falls short... and speaking of short.. if the delivery were better and the clues/solutions a bit more logical this game would take all of about 10 minutes to play though.  I wish I could give this a 5 star rating but even though it is entertaining and has a good atmosphere it just leaves you wishing for more. But the creators have my sincere appreciation and applause. I wish more gaming companies would work to supply the fans of this genre with hours and hours of entertaining deduction."

Also the last puzzle was really finicky (blue circles on basement door) and the lightest touch will cause it to reset so that even if you've solved it once, you're forced to do so again (and again). Also, the ending was lame - a real anticlimax.It was also pretty easy, but I don't mind this if there are a lot of visually interesting scenes or landscapes.  In this game the graphics were nice but again there were only around ten different settings."

Just enough of an eerie feeling to make it interesting, but not scary at all. What I really like about this game is that I don't have to sit and play it for hours. I was satisfied playing it in 10 minute increments in between doing other things. If I had played it non-stop it probably would have taken an hour or so to complete. I do like that it didn't drag on forever, although I would have liked another level or something. The ending was underwhelming, but the journey was enjoyable enough to convince me to buy The Lost City, the latest game from this developer. I hope they make more of these types of games. Even though they're short, they're well-worth the low price, so much went into making them look beautiful, sound moody, and play without hiccups."

They're challenging enough that you'll scratch your head for a bit, but won't be too difficult for the sake of being difficult.My main problem with this is that its too expensive. Almost 2 dollars for a game that you can beat in less than an hour? I've spent 4 dollars on other apps that have a gameplay of 20+ hours and its still going. Wish it was longer, or at least that they would make a free version with advertisement throughout the game."

The fact that it was short, played in less than two hours with a granddaughter, by candlelight and flashlight (power outage)  and the ending was a 'cop-out&#34;, caused me to be disappointed.However, I am sure that children and preteens will enjoy it, so based on age I think it will work fine for some.  Being a 79 year oldGreat Granny (who has played mysteries with grandchildren) might not make me the right person to review this adequately, for those of younger ages.  I guess what I am saying, is the challenge is there for the much younger generations, though not necessarily for teenagers."

    "reviewText": "This is really a simplistic type of format...few locations and a TON of running around in them. The movement is a little clunky and some of few locations are only used once. The look was ok, nothing froze or went wrong on my Kindle Fire HD 8.9\" The reason for the 3 stars, which is in itself abstract, is that there is no help. If you get stuck, you're on your own OR you have to resort to the internet walkthrough. Not fun for me. Even with the help online, I quickly realized that I would never have figured some of the puzzles, clues and their use or finished this game. For me, maybe it's more like a 1-star, but I know this game has a cult following of obviously clever folks who are able to solve the clues and I want to encourage all game makers to give us Kindle people MORE!"

Unlike The Lost City, this game does not have the hint and map features, so it's up to you to figure out the clues and locate the puzzle pieces.  That being said, I finished the game in a few hours and wished there was more to it.  I agree that it could have been longer with more screens. Again, the graphics were nicely done, the puzzles fairly easy to solve, and it worked well on my Kindle Fire.This had a nice balance between clever and challenging clues.I probably would have been less disappointed if I had played this game first and followed it with The Lost City."

    "reviewText": "Got this game on my tablet around the time that its popularity really took off. I must say, this is defiantly fun in every possible term of a Mystery/Search and Find game app. There are a bunch of mini-puzzles that are good brain challengers, but are still quite fun. Erie music really adds to the feeling of mystery as you search Grandpa's house and his estate for clues as to his whereabouts. Great graphics, even for a game that doesn't have too much visual movement. Overall, the game itself is quite fun and enjoyable. There are just two things that aren't too pleasing: first thing is that it doesn't give any hints or anything like that to help you pass the puzzles and find some objects. Sure, most people will want to solve the mystery on there own, but on some of those really hard puzzles, there's no way to get a hint in any form anywhere. Other games similar to this one give small hints to those who need them, but not this game. Really wish this is something that they could add. And second, the game itself is a little too short. If your stuck on a puzzle for like, two months, that really isn't any short amount of time to pass a game like this. But in general, this game is kind of short. And I'm pretty sure that they could have made it longer easily.Besides these things, this is still a very fun app with a mystery that I'm sure you'll have allot of fun solving. Any problems that you'll find in this app will be small and won't hinder your game play in any great way. I'm pretty sure that you'll enjoy it when you get it."

To be fair, a point-and-click adventure game featuring puzzles around a an abandoned mansion is hardly a new idea, but it felt like plagiarism.Regardless, the Secret of Grisly Manor holds up ok on its own.Pros: Challenging puzzles, point-and-click gameplay, decent atmosphereCons: way too short (about 1/2 hour), poorly detailed graphics (looks like very old compression), a couple of seemingly arbitrary puzzles/solutionsConclusion: I pray that we are seeing a revival of point-and-click adventure games for tablets. Buy this game if you have 49 cents to spare, enjoy classic adventure games, and have already played the Mystery of Crimson Manor."

Although this isn't my favorite kind of game, it's still a bit nostalgic and refreshing to play the classic puzzle/adventure style game. They did a decent job with it.Cons:Story wasn't all that impressive, and usually that's what really sells this genre of game(i.e. it's no 7th guest). Game is pretty short as well. And with most games like this, i generally throw away strategy and logic and just start clicking places until something new happens, thus ruining the game for myself lol. Not the games fault, just not 'my thing'. 3 stars is purely based on game though.. and a slight lack of compelling story elements and being short made what could of been a decent game, just ok.Should you buy? Worth grabbing today to play through. I wouldn't personally drop a dollar on this, i like a little more action than a game of this caliber is willing to provide, and the puzzles here are nothing to brag about. But for the people who love this adventure/puzzle style game, it's worth a play through."

However, Grisly Manor seems more like a prototype rather than a fully formed game and features present in the subsequent games are sorely missed here.  The Journal is particular, which saves a great deal of time retracing the path back to previously-explored rooms to review clues to puzzles.  On the other hand, perhaps that was deliberate in order to artificially inflate the amount of time it takes to solve the game.  Because as short as Mosaika and Lost City are, Grisly is practically a blip.  The puzzle solutions in Grisly weren't as involved either, which is troubling as the other games are not exactly complex.  The Secret of Grisly Manor has atmosphere in its graphics and sound, but as a puzzle game, while acceptable, it doesn't compare to the rest of Fire Maple Games' offerings, even at 99 cents."

    "reviewText": "Music library synchronization for Droid users: solved. Woo hoo...Since becoming an Android user I've been tolerant of \"good enough\" music synchronization capabilities offered by other applications (including the upgrade/pro version ofWinampand doubleTwist. One (Winamp) was good enough, while doubleTwist had serious issues that led me to uninstall and look for other solutions.The turn to Amazon MP3 came when Amazon added its \"AutoRip\" service to user accounts. In short: if you were already using Amazon's cloud player (I was), they added the tracks from any CDs purchased from Amazon (since 1998) to your cloud player list. Since I had already made an \"Amazon over iTunes store\" decsion earlier, this became an ideal solution for me. Essentially, all music I've ever purchased from Amazon is available in cloud streaming and .mp3 formats (and presumably I still have the physical media from CD purchases, which are not so frequent in my house these days).As for the player itself: it quickly indexed the .mp3 contents of my phone and flawlessly accesses my cloud content (network connections permitting). It automatically switches between Bluetooth and headphones, depending on the what I'm playing the music to. The interface is uncluttered and intuitive. Once you've made the decision to turn control of your music inventory over to Amazon...the rest is easy!"

But, the new version of the app has made playing songs from my device a miserable experience.  Where it worked flawlessly a few days ago, it now takes MINUTES for a song to play.  I give up on it working, put it back in my pocket, and a few minutes later hear the song take off.  Skipping ahead?  Nope.  Pausing?  Yeah, that works well still.  Why does the new version affect songs that are stored to my device?  I don't understand it."

Now I have a ton of music online and use this player almost exclusively.The main complaint I have is that the Player doesnt remember where I was the last time I ran it. This is a big issue when trying to listen to audio books. Everytime I close the program for a second (hit the home key or switch tasks) I have to remember where I was in the current track. And then when I reopen I (many times) have to scroll to find my album, the tack then click cose to where I was. It is just too hard. Save the last location and I give this a 5 star.UPDATE: When Amazon enacted their limits to songs/ storage or purchase this year I deleted it. Storage is so very cheap now (especially for Amazon, who doesn't have to actually store each song, but only a marker saying we have access to the song) and there are so many competitors (Google Play Music, for instance) I can't justify using this app. I downloaded all my songs (which took almost a day!) then deleted. You've lost me, Amazon MP3, until you give back unlimited storage."

You can select to display the music in the Cloud, previously downloaded to the device, or access the Amazon \"Store\". The app also allows downloading your Cloud stored MP3 files to your device but, as other reviewers have noted, it does not allow you to select where they are stored (i.e. to your SD card). The download location shortcoming is not a significant issue for me since I don't have a lot of music files, but this would be an issue for someone like my daughter who has hundreds of files.The ease of use and access to the Cloud stored files makes this a good choice for my needs.Recommended!CFH"

And because I unknowingly installed the latest update, I now have Amazon Music. My main complaint is that it only works in portrait. I have a Sony Tablet S. For my tablet I have both a charging stand and a different stand that I use at work - both landscape. I have to keep turning it to portrait to see the lists and controls and menus. Am I mistaken that tablets are poplar now? This set up for a phone. Plus I keep getting code number errors and have to restart my tablet. I've emailed Amazon 3 times and had to reinstall  yesterday. What a pain. I definitely don't want Prime Music and it is always on there asking if I do or if I want to  purchase with that or regular. It switches menus when I try to listen to more than one song on an album, taking time for the switch that I could have been listening to the sample tracks. Plus, I do not want people on Facebook knowing what I'm listening to. Who cares? And that's an invasion of my privacy. Can you tell that I don't like this and I'm very unhappy with it? I'm starting to like Walkman and Songza more and more."

Otherwise the albums that were supposed to be downloaded didn't show up.

Simply put, this app is not up to Amazon standards IMO."

It is easy to make a playlist, find a song, play a song, buy a song, or whatever else you usually need to do with .mp3's.  I love it!I also love how it ties into the cloud services and allows me to download my .mp3 purchases with a few taps on the screen.Somebody had complained that you couldn't make a playlist with song both on your local device and from the cloud.  While this is true, you can easily download the songs onto your device and then add them to your playlist.  Easy peasy!The only thing I wish I could do is to bookmark songs within a playlist.  I would love it if they would add it as it would be really easy.  I like to listen to both .mp3 music files and audiobook files and having a bookmark feature would allow me to switch between music and the spoken word without loosing my place inside of a book.  Amazon: PLEASE ADD!!  I have purchased (yes, I paid money) another book reader, Ambling BookPlayer, for this feature alone. I would love to have it all in one central location.Otherwise, this is great especially with it being tied into the Amazon Cloud storage services.  Just awesome!"

I really don't have to worry about hogging up the memory on the device and I still have an unlimited data plan and plan to keep until I am forced over to capped plan :)Now the bad. Performance wise it just sucks. No nice way to put it. I was searching for a song through the app, force closes =/. Attempted to play the song through via cloud, times out and either prompts for a force close or ask to wait. Seems to be hit or miss right now. Maybe its carrier performance or maybe its app, but if i can stream video via Netflix or Crackle, i tend to point to a performance issue with the app. I truly understand the difficulties of having to make the app compatible with the different devices. Like a computer, you can run windows, but depending on hardware you may not be able to run something someone else can. That said, I hope they address the performance issue in the near future. Oh I am using the Motorola Atrix."

I've attempted fresh installs and clearing the cache but none of this has been successful. Even reading somewhere that the app was not compatible with equalizers, which I would hope has at least been accommodated by this point; disabling the equalizer features has been unsuccessful. After these problems and no fix, I just uninstalled it."

(!!!)My phone has 8GB- will spare you the math, but it's an obvious flaw that has yet to be corrected.Apparently this app is designed for people who just sit and listen to music- perhaps people reading on their Kindles.Great if you're sedentary - not so much so for other demographics.The default LG Music app is actually more user-friendly/easier to use under mobile conditions.(This tells you how bad the Amazon Music with Prime Music app is).Just found out this morning that it deleted all playlists on my device with the upgrade.OH....SOoooo not happy about that.I thought they were on the SD card- my bad; yeah, I (now know that I) should have backed them up.I spent a lot of time in hospital waiting rooms generating those playlists (not at leisure at home at a PC where I could create, port, etc.).Am not happy about this.I see no reason to use my mobile bandwidth to listen to Amazon Prime.(I don't sit in coffee shops/school environs with free WiFi).When I'm on a road trip- it's my bandwidth that's used if so.I have a huge SD card with tons of songs, and I don't need to use bandwidth to listen.Prime Music offers me nothing in this situation.If I'm at home, fine.But it simply doesn't serve a new function for me- I have already Spotify / Pandora if I want ambient sound at home, with selections, playlists, etc. already set up.What do I gain here by using this app?Whatever I do gain- it's incremental/likely not worth the additional effort.Amazon's late to the game on this.Will simply be buying less from Amazon Music because I won't be using their app (won't be running across products to buy)."

That was my criteria for choosing this type of app. I like that we can play the music by accessing the amazon music cloud and not just by downloading each song on my kindle as long as I have wifi. I vary the amount of music I want loaded in my kindle and this app makes it easy and convenient to download individual songs or remove them and leave them only in the music cloud to save space. There is a limit to space available without paying for more and it is ok but not great. How can we complain though for a free app with free reliable service. The music streams seamlessly from the app or the cloud when playing, as well"

All the wasted megabytes for their album cover cache, and you can get about 15 or 20 albums at most on the phone (depending on other apps you have) before you will fill up an S3. Streaming is fine, but that only works when you are on Wi-Fi unless you want to eat up your small (these days) monthly G4 LTE bandwidth cap. Which is fine if you only listen to your music occasionally, but not so cool if you are an every day audiophile like anyone who would bother to pay a monthly fee for Amazon's MP3 cloud progam. So yeah, it's useless. Deleted app, canceling cloud subscription, will just use a competitor cloud product and rip CD's or whatever, if they can't make it convenient, then what good is it, really?"

    "reviewText": "I have used the AmazonMP3 app both for listening to and purchasing music directly to my phone since the app was first introduced. The app, mostly, performs as expected. It is simple and relatively easy to use. HOWEVER, the app does not allow you to download your music to your phone's SD card, it will only download to internal memory. This is a large inconvenience for those of us who do not always have a wifi signal or have 3g/4g data caps. I travel a fair amount of time and want to have my music available on those long flights. Plus listening to music on my phone's memory is much better on battery life than streaming.Other MP3 app makers have addressed this in their apps.  Google has recognized this issue with their Google Music app and has allowed download to SD since March 2012.  Why Amazon cannot figure this out is beyond me. In the end this will hurt Amazon more than its users. We, as users, have choice and the ability to walk away from AmazonMP3 and choose another music vendor. I can say that I have withheld purchasing many albums from AmazonMP3 for this reason.Until Amazon rectifies this omission from their app, I cannot, in good faith, give AmazonMP3 a positive review. 2 stars until this changes, 4-5 stars if Amazon gets on the ball and makes the fix."

On my Samsung Galaxy Note II I just discovered that this software downloads your music to the phone's internal memory and there is no workaround. So my new 64gb card is next to useless when I am purchasing MP3 albums from Amazon (which also sold me the 64gb SD card.) This is truly a brain dead piece of software for folks who frequently purchase MP3 albums. Factor that into your decision to download this and purchase MP3 music from Amazon. It's a no-win situation.Original Review:No doubt this is a convenient application and has made my Droid X my best friend (not to mention my dramatically increased number of purchases of MP3 albums from Amazon!)What I love most: cloud storage, and the fact that any MP3 music purchased from Amazon is stored for free, regardless of how much space it takes up. I also love the fact that whenever I purchase a new album it's immediately available to play from the cloud or to download directly to my Droid X.Now for the bad: if I am playing music for hours my device will freeze and I have to force the application to close. And when I say my device freezes, I mean everything until I get a pop-up informing me of such and asking if I want to wait, cancel or force it closed.Another issue I have is when I am downloading MP3 albums that come as disc 1 and 2 (or more), each virtual disc names the tracks with a number, then title. So when they download, virtual disc 1, track 1 downloads, then virtual disc 2, track 1 follows, and so on for every track. The track list is seriously out of order. This is a problem Amazon needs to resolve, even if it means a different naming convention for tracks from multiple virtual discs (i.e., disc 1 would be A-1-track name, and disc 2 would be B-1-track name or some similar scheme. It is not insurmountable.As for accessing my music from the cloud - I have scant luck playing songs from the cloud when I am driving and it's hit or miss at home unless I have WiFi turned on, so I am forced to play from songs stored on my device when I am not near WiFi. I have more music stored in the cloud than my phone will hold, which is why it can be a pain, but I think that may be a limitation of my provider (Verizon) instead of any shortcoming with Amazon. Just be aware that it can be an issue of the underlying technology, including your service provider's infrastructure.Despite my complaints, I have reached the point where I cannot live without the app, so I guess liking it is optional."

I finally discovered that pushing the back &#34;button&#34; twice quickly on my device  I could get to my music.  This is not how an app which is supposed to stream music I pay for (either by purchasing it or by subscribing to prime) is supposed to behave.  I really wish there was an alternative app."

    "reviewText": "I was very excited when I learnt that Amazon has decided to allow streaming of most of the popular music for Prime Members like me but my excitement did not last very long when I found several bugs & limitation in this Amazon Music app for Android. Granted it is too early to comment as the app is new but certain basic concepts are flawed.The most important for any phone or tablet is the limited space one has for storing music files and since this app saves music for offline listening into default internal memory and no way for the user to select where to store it (External SD card) it is very limited on how many songs you can save on the limited internal storage.It is never practical to be connected to Wi-Fi at all times on a portable device to listen to music from the cloud storage, it is also not practical to stream using your data plan all day so currently the app is flawed. I am sure eventually Amazon will release updates to fix this until then I have really no use for it on my phone and tablets.Also, there are number of bugs and more notably the app gives a lot of exception errors and asks to contact customer  service and the downloaded songs do not play. Even killing the app and restarting does not resolve the issue. Currently you cannot listen or re-download the songs till you clear your cache of this APP. If it encounters download errors (Which it does on a regular basis) you have no choice but to again kill the app clear the cache and re-download again or try again and again which is very frustrating.Also the album art goes out of sync when shuffling. The Song title does not match with the song it is playing, The album art disappears when you are not online on certain songs, the Equalizer does not seem to have no effect and the list of bugs goes on...It is indeed a nice offer from Amazon to allow unlimited streaming of popular songs to Prime Members but this APP should have been the first thing they must have paid more attention and get it right as all that effort that they have put into cloud services for streaming music is worthless without a proper working APP.I am rating this with 2 stars currently but I am positive Amazon will improve this in the future and I will revise my review accordingly.Thanks for reading my review."

We had the free upgraded cloud storage because of Amazon music purchases. But the cloud player really isn't worth the new $25/year, and the free 250-song limit is not going to cut it for us. So, we deleted our music from the cloud and are moving to google music.The Amazon mp3 app itself was ok, but never great. Leaving it is not a hard decision. Initially, I had imported all our music from iTunes. It copied the playlists, but nit the folder hierarchy, so dozens of organized playlists became a massive mess. Streaming worked ok, but obviously was heavily dependent ion the network connection. So I ended up copying my most-listened-to music to my sd card, and the built-in music player works very well."

This was one of Amazon's \"Free App of the Day\" so it was an easy choice to try. This wallpaper is a fairly simple game that allows you to explode regenerating pumpkins and knock vampire bats out of the air by tapping them in quick succession. This can cause the inadvertent launching of apps if you play this on a cluttered screen, so I only play it on a fairly empty screen.This is a seasonal app (at least for me) and I will likely change my wallpaper back to a picture of my family after Halloween.Recommended!

You have some options with a few different backgrounds:-you can choose between 3 colors of fog and how much fog is on the screen.-choose how many pumpkins but u can not remove them all-there are bats that fly around on the screen which you can remove.I guess it can also be a game too since u can get points for smashing pumpkins and bats, it will keep track for you.  But that got old after 10 seconds.Parts of the app are nice but I would like to be able to remove all pumpkins or at least move them where I want, just so an apps icon is not sitting directly on top of one.  There was a pumpkin sitting directly underneath my camera apps icon and it made it semi difficult to see.5 stars for the app fitting the description.1 star for how much I want to use it."

How do I know what to edit if I don't know what it looks like?Other problems include a clunky interface and an inability to schedule posts.Some good points: I can easily jump between my blogs.

I love the app when looking for a movie, and I am kind of an IMDb junkie so in general like the tool.The thing that was bugging me was the news feeds. They would get stale, and couldn't figure out how to refresh (and I am talking by weeks not hours).So that may have been addressed in the last release.Also would be nice to attach to Amazon more(since it is owned by them) so I could watch directly or see pricing easier but I may just not know how to work that.The trailer stream great even at 3G which is good when you got to entertain a 4 yo for a few minutes."

    "reviewText": "When I bought my KF it came preloaded with the IMDb app. I was excited and was anxious to use it. It didn't take long to completely hate it. In any case, Amazon now says it's not compatible, so my assumption is that the app was upgraded and doesn't work well on KF now. In truth, I wouldn't know because of the reason I stated before; I don't like it, so I don't use it anymore and let me tell you why.* It only displays the abbreviated version of IMDb and is difficult to navigate. I love the Trivia items and it is a pain in the neck to find the link on any given page.* Unlike using the web browser, you cannot search the page for text. When you are perusing a prolific star's list of films or TV, it is very tedious looking for one lone title. Page text search is an absolute must have.* Also it doesn't offer tabbed viewing. I like opening up various pages in separate tabs, so I don't have to constantly hit the back and forward buttons.Really, those are my only complaints but those are all the complaints I need to make me decide to never use it again.There is one more point I wish to make and this is in their favor. One reviewer complained saying that you still have to be connected to the net in order to use it and so found it useless. Yes, you do have to be connected but can you imagine the size of download that would contain all of that information? We're talking hundreds of thousands of pages! If you've ever tried usingiBird Pro 2you'll know right away what I'm talking about.iBird Pro 2has less than 1,000 entries and is an enormous, time consuming, pain in the butt, download. Imagine that a hundred times worse. Yep, that's what you'd get.The point of the app is to make it fast. I will admit that it IS fast. It loads a lot more quickly than the web version. That said, the two complaints I have still trump it's speed.Sorry, IMDb. Your app stinks. Fix those two problems and make sure it's KF compatible and I'll be satisfied."

Obviously those complaining about this never checked the settings or help. My problem with the settings, though, is that the current state is not displayed. Each time you touch the option button, it goggles to the opposite state. If that's not the one you want, you have to toggle again.I started with the kids mode just to sample the interface and game play. So far so good. It's not a true RPG. You advance a level (dungeon) by making words. The higher the value of the word the more destructive it is against the level's monster. Each fight depletes some of your health. When out of health the game ends.Final word: be skeptical of low ratings.  The player probably didn't spend much time playing the game. And if someone says they'll never buy anything from this developer in future there may be more to the story than the game play."

It's a bit like scrabble, where you are given a set of letters to make words in order to 'defend yourself' after you have been attacked by mice, skeletons, etc. You face these beings in dungeons, and these dungeons are shown on a World Map. The map shows where you are, and how many dungeons you will have to go through (which are a lot).You are able to choose your own game mode, and these are your options:Kid Mode - starts with extra health, words do double damageNormal - Standard RulesWizard - Experts only! Starts on Dungeon 4. No oracle tilesYou really have to get creative with the words, for you cannot use the same word twice (it seems ever), so I can see this being a perfect game for a person really into puzzles.For me personally it was a pretty good game, but I don't think I would get through the entire map in one sitting. It's definitely something for me to check into every once and a while when I'm bored, because it is a challenging game, it's just a tad redundant.However, once you amass a certain amount of points there are extra squares you are given that have powers that play to your advantage (like a healing one, extra points, oracle eye that creates the best word out of all your letters, etc  etc).But I love the added paranormal-ish element to it - it's not just a regular word game. There are probably added features that I haven't gotten to (I'm on the fifth dungeon right now), so I can't wait to see what else is offered. I also appreciate that there are different modes, so you can practice a little and receive hints on how to play in the kid mode before attempting the normal or wizard modes."

    "reviewText": "You start each dungeon (level) with several letters and 15 hit points. You face multiple enemies one after another and form words to attach their hit points. They attack as well and you will lose HP as you play. Longer words hit harder and so on. As you kill enemies you also get special letters worth double HP attacks or magic pieces that tell you the best word to attack with. Your hit points are reset and you keep unused special pieces after each level.So basically Boggle with a theme.Unlike many reviewers I didn't think much of the game. It has a very boring interface, low Res graphics - each dungeon is a door with enemies in front of it. If this game were a true dungeon crawler with the ability to move where you wanted and to have random enemies encounters and maybe a point this would be better. I am thinking of an old school dungeon crawler on a PC aand this setup doesn't compare. There isn't even a story.But it isn't a data miner and the game works so 3 stars. Just OK."

It is also a bit Monty Hall when looked at as a quest game instead of purely as a timed word game.It is a challenging word game, especially when you are attempting to make a word from rapidly shifting letter tiles.  I also find the objects found after defeating the various foes pretty amusing.All in all, a cute little word game with an interesting slant, good for a waiting-room game.  With a little more complexity (ie collecting found items for a bonus,  or perhaps an honest-to-goodness quest), and the option to save your progress,  this has the potential to be a 5-star game."

    "reviewText": "I really enjoyed playing this game. I like word games such as Text Twist and RPG/Sim games too. This game blends them together nicely. There are 3 levels of difficulty Kid Mode, Normal, and Wizard. I started with Normal. You are given letter tiles with which you have to make words to defeat enemy creatures and monsters of variable strength and attack speed. That's right, the enemies don't just stand there while you &quot;cast spells&quot; (make words) at them, they fight back! This basically serves as a timer to make words. Along the way you can earn magic tiles and power ups to help you make words, increase damage to enemies, increase your health etc. I beat Normal on the first try but it was a little challenging towards the end. I assume Kid Mode is really easy for anyone to play. I'm definitely going to try Wizard mode though. Replay value is moderate. I would have given 5 stars but when I beat the game, I couldn't enter my name and post it to the leader board. I tapped the space to type my name but the keyboard wouldn't appear. I'm using the stock keyboard, not an app. Please fix this! HTC Thunderbolt stock rooted."

    "summary": "A good word game but I did not like having to start over every time once you get beat!",
    "reviewText": "The object of the game is to make words from the available letters and the longer the word the better.  These words are like magic spells and they destroy the various creatures living in the dungeon.  There are 25 dungeons that need your skills. If your word is too small it will not destroy the evil creature you are fighting.  It takes multiple words to kill some creatures and you are facing a timer.  The letters don't get added very quickly so you are using the same letters to form as many words as possible out of mostly the same letters so it can get difficult.  There are special tiles to increase damage, restore health, and many other features but they don't come often in the game. They are described in the Help section of the game so I will not go over the long list here.This is a pretty good word game and the killing of the creatures is just a little twist to keep you entertained.  I like the power up tiles and they do help a lot.  I didn't care that whenever you get defeated you have to start all the way back to the first dungeon again.  I was in a higher dungeon level, about 5 or 6 levels in and the timer ran out and I finally got beat and I had to start the journey all over.Touching Scores does let you see scores on the world score board or you can see your local scores only if you want.  This is one of the features that make me always wonder what else is being shared with the world?  This is why I do not like full internet access as you always wonder what else is going on.  As a single player game it doesn't really need internet access and this unnecessary permission should be turned off.  When you complete your game it asks for your game name and you can save your score and choose not to share your score with the online server.The help instructions are good and take the time to read them as they can be helpful to get you quickly up to speed. The game played well on the Kindle Fire and I turned the music down to an acceptable level using the Kindle's volume slider.I gave the game 4 stars as I thought it was a good game.  The one star deduction is for having to start over at the beginning if you lose after getting multiple levels into the game and for having full internet access.  Making you start over just makes the game action redundant and not nearly as much fun as seeing new creatures and challenges in a game.  I detected no spyware or data mining going on.Options:* Toggle all sounds on/off* Toggle music on/off* Shake to jumble letters* Reset quick tips* Reset high scoresMain Screen:* Play* Scores* Options* Help* About - a long list of creditsPermissions:Network communication - full internet accessSize is 7.9 MB uncompressed and once it installed the 224 KB went into the Kindle Fire app memory and 12.506 MB went into the memory reserved for you books and other data."

It also seems to be a game with magic spells and they destroy the various creatures living in the dungeon, there are about 25 dungeons. You need to come up with words that can destroy the creatures that live in the dungeons. Some creatures require multiple word solving skills to destroy them so you get the idea what this game is about.There are help screens that explain the rules and controls are simple and works perfectly on kindle fire. Overall it is plain old word game but with a twist wherein you get to kill creatures by solving word puzzles.The game needs full internet access but can be played by turning off WiFi. The price is little on the higher side, wished it would be just 99c like most of the apps. But, if you love dark dungeons and want to solve word puzzles and the same time the price of $1.99 seems justified."

    "reviewText": "Dungeon Scroll is a pretty good word game, one that would have been better if it wasn't so full of little annoyances.It cleverly combines \"Typing of the Dead\" with word puzzles, and does so almost flawlessly.You create words by using the provided letters every level, and use them to cast spells, which in turn kill the monsters that try to do the same thing to you.I like the little twist it puts on the regular word puzzler by letting you re-use your letters to create new words. To balance this out, the game stops you from using the same exact word once it is used. You are allowed however, to use variations. So you can type \"night\", and then \"nights\" right after.This word block is reset every dungeon (level), so once you get past your current level, you are free to re-use the words used in your previous one.By killing monsters and descending deeper into the dungeon, you will get treasures, which are \"power up\" letters or potions that will carry over from level to level. Using these in word creation results in everything from healing to bonus damage.The graphics and sound, while nothing to write home about - are more than adequate for a game of this type.If it wasn't for the annoying network permission and the ability to go to the rtsoft.com website (where you can purchase more games from the developer), it would be almost perfect.I also don't appreciate them sneaking their Twitter and newsletter options into the Help menu.Finally I have an issue with the game not allowing you to continue where you left off after you die. You can save the game by quitting, but I was on level nine and was destroyed by a particularly nasty critter, forcing me to restart the game from the start.A better solution would have been to send you back one level, or allow you to use a resurrection scroll that you could find every few levels.Now I don't quite think this game is worth $1.99 (twice what similar word games go for), it is certainly a good FAOTD. If it ever goes down to $.99, I would also recommend it, but for the price of two games it is not quite worth it."

The dictionary that you play with has words that even people with a good vocabulary will never find them all.

This latest version of the audible player for Android is not as good as the older Audible player versions.The newest version starts with a smiley photo of someone allegedly having fun listening to Audible audiobooks. But it's a waste of time and memory space. Also, the app needs to synchronize & authorized your book files every  time it opens now. That little process is achingly slow. And it only affirms the stuff on your machine. If you really want to download the newest audio digest newspaper from your account, you have to sync again with your online library...more time waiting....For me, it's better than not having Audible, but I wish Amazon wouldn't mess with things so much making the app worse in operation trying to tighten the ties between Audible & Amazon. What I expect to happen sometime down the line is that Audible will disappear as branding and only Amazon will remain. The service will become some &#34;AudioKindle&#34; thingy in time.It saddens me, but as I said, you can't go back again. They won't let us."

    "reviewText": "I've had an account with Audible since...well..a couple of months after they opened shop. Back then, it was easier and cheaper to convert the books to CD than to get an MP3 player with enough capacity to hold a whole book.  But that's a whole other story.Pretty much, I love the app.  It syncs up just fine, loading in all the books in my library that I have bought over the years.  I can shop directly from the app, so I can grab a new title while on the road.  I like that I can start listening even before a book download is completed, especially given the size of some of them.  The app offers several sorting methods, plays just fine in the background, and I have yet to have it crash on me.  The color scheme works well, easy to read.  The 30 second reverse button is handy, especially if a loud vehicle or some other distraction comes along and drowns out the sound.  When calls come in, it pauses nicely and resumes when I end the call.There are two things I don't care for however, which is why the app only gets four stars instead of 5.  One is that it doesn't seem to always remember what it was doing last.  If I pause the playback, exit the app, then come back, it may and may not remember what it was doing at the time.  When it doesn't remember, it puts me back at the main library menu, leaving me to scroll back to the book and part that I was listening to.  It always remembers where in the book/part I left off at least.  The second thing is the interaction when I get a notification.  The notification tone overrides the app, causing me to miss whatever was said for the duration of the tone.  (That's another point where the 30 second reverse button is handy.)  While I don't have long notification sounds, someone who does will miss quite a bit."

I really take pleasure in listening while relaxing with my needles in the evenings. I like reading as much as I like being productive so with audible I can do both. I give it 4 stars because the price is way too high. Unless you buy the book first, you can get a discount on some audio books. Some of them I never read, just listen. I would buy more audio books if the price was lower, because I really enjoy it. Even though I have an iPad I still and always will buy my books and music from Amazon because Apple's customer service sucks. I'm happy that I can get my Amazon contents and have it on my iPad. All my audio books downloaded automatically on the audible right after I downloaded the app.One thing if you put the voice of the reader on fast  it skips words and sounds like mumble jumble. If you put it on a slower read it just sounds like echo."

    "reviewText": "Second time I've tried Audible.  Now that Amazon owns it, it's worse than ever. You have to sign up for the subscription of $14.95/month that gives you one credit a month.  A new John Grisham novel is listed at $35!!!  How many credits does each book cost - varies.  It's very tailored to get you to also buy a Kindle.I also cannot get my old title transferred to the &#34;new&#34; Audible.  I keep entering my old log-in info, it will say it was accepted but then returns to log-in screen.  Chat is not working to merge my accounts, so I have to call.  The desktop program is like something from the early 90's and I can't transfer books to my android phone.  Spent hours trying to manually transfer the book - no go.  Instructions are a mess, files are cryptic and you can't find anything and don't know if the app downloaded the book or is streaming it.  It is listed under both tabs, yet I can't listen to one of my books.  I don't know if the one I can listen to is being stream or is actually downloaded to my phone.  Files are tied to your log-in, NO SHARING with someone else who had Audible!I've been around long enough to have lost songs I purchased when the &#34;proprietary licensing&#34; is no longer supported.  Apparently this happened to the old Audible.  AND you will NOT be able to listen to your books without the Audible software.  So if you decide not to subscribe, you have to keep it loaded on your device to listen to that book you just spent a fortune on.CD's are less expensive, easier to convert to MP3, and then you can give it to as many friends as you'd like, same with a paperback book.  Better yet, start uploading them to Pirate Bay - I now see why they exist when companies pull this cr*p.  It would be one thing if digital media was less expensive, but it's more expensive!  One book or audio CD can be passed around and resold and there's no risk of it becoming unusable because of a format change.Stick with your library or go buy something you can actually keep and share.  CD's aren't dead as far as audiobooks go."

I can't view my orders, my account, track packages, or anything like that.I would just like to have more options that what is provided. Also, the layout is very difficult to navigate. I mean, if you are a loyal Amazon fan like me I'd download it just to have it but don't expect to use it much.99% of the time I just pull Amazon up on my phones browser since the app is so useless."

Amazon is almost always cheaper than local stores, so its an easy way to save money.Ordering items through the app is very easy. I have completed the process several times and had no errors or order problems.The one problem I have with this app is the bar code scanner. I can almost never get bar code scanners to work and this app is no different. I often feel like an idiot standing in a store trying to get this app to read a bar code. On the flip side, the app almost always finds the item I am looking for when I search via keyword search or texting a picture."

Does it show up as a little blue icon in your taskbar every couple of hours saying there are updates to it, or other things you buy with it? The Appstore app does that, with the orange icon showing up several times a day \"asking\" you if you would like to update it.  Soon as you clear it out, it comes back a couple of hours later.  Also, the apps you download have updates (however major or minor), and every time an app has an update (that you either want or don't want), the Amazon icon pops up on my phone telling me there is an update waiting.  Also, I don't download updates as soon as they come out for ANYTHING and instead wait until I see how the reviews are for that update so I don't make a hasty mistake and can keep the old one if it's better or I'm waiting for a fix.  So, until that time, I am bombarded with reminders from Amazon on the main screen of my phone with NO ABILTIY TO TURN OFF THESE ANNOYING ALERTS. I already have this blue Amazon app on my phone, but I am very hesitant in even opening it until I find out whether this app ALSO has the INABILITY TO TURN OFF THE INCESSANT ALERTS.  I will just keep looking at reviews before I find a satisfactory answer.  I already emailed Amazon about the Appstore app problems (last major update to it was just 2 days ago), and they pretty much sent me a generic email saying \"at this time, it's not a feature...\" so I don't want to waste my time with Amazon again on asking about THIS app, and trust that other customers will give me the skinny on how this app functions.  As it stands now, the ratings are poor, but I really want to find out about how much they alert/contact you and whether Amazon let's you control these alerts.  Thank you."

It becomes nightmare when these apps try to run every hour, you'll end up getting these message every hour.The reason that I uninstall Appstore is because it's constantly running in the background doing something. Not only it's a privacy concern, it also slows down the phone and drains its battery.To Amazon App department, please follow Amazon Retail business model; which is offer excellent services and prices with no string attached.

    "reviewText": "First, I've been shopping on Amazon.com for a long while & with the addition of this app, it only adds up more convenience & ease to my shopping experience. This app provides a reliable on-the-go access to Amazon's vast data base where you can find:  Amazon's pricing, customer's ratings, reviews, and product full description. Your searches are saved & synced with your Amazon Account. Sweet :-)The Mash Up:1) Clean & easy to navigate UI. Thumbs up on that.2)  Versatile search options:  customers can search any given product they may come across by Name, Barcode or Photo. Of course, to get to use photo search you'd have to go to' More' drop menu, scroll down to `Amazon Remembers' &  snap your photo from there. Results, at least for me, have been really impressive. But I won't be surprised if I heard there were some mismatches or off results. My only suggestion in regard to product searchability is to unify all three search options in the Search Box. That would make it more easily accessible. One click & you're in for what you need instead of digging up menus! Make sense, right?! Plus, it won't hurt to add SKU/ UPC search & more types of barcodes lookups.3) Also, I like the fact that you can check your `Wish' Lists. Odd enough, you won't see your `Shopping List' which I honestly don't see any use of this particular distinction?!! I'd suggest implementing Push notifications of price changes for items on your Wish Lists [ which I rather call Watch List] so that you never miss a chance to best spend your hard earned dimes'4)  You also can view & track you orders. This section needs to be improved. My only `beef `to this segment is that it doesn't offer the same info you'd expect to find logging into your account from your computer!5) I definitely would love to see Customers being able to send Price Feed on items in brick & mortar stores.  This will lit up price fights & may the best offer win!6) Now as far as performance, this app is well built. It never crashed on my Epic 4G (before nor after I got my Froyo update). It is stable, never crashed on my phone, loads up fast, & works like a champ!7) I'm sure to recommend this app to a friend. It's helped me make better buying choices. If you're an impulse buyer, you sure want to have this app on your smartphone to help you make `smarter' choices ;-)  I'd love to think that app developers actually read customers reviews & feedback on their app. Fingers crossed '"

As other guy mentioned, the permissions this app asks for, a little strange. With that and the overall experience this app feels more like bloatware, something that verizon would stick on a phone, than a clean app that makes my life easier. Lot of potential in a good amazon app, so I hope they put more time into this."

Clicking on the &quot;full site&quot; link sorta works, except as soon as you click on a link, it reverts to mobile. I usually give up and don't end up buying what I was looking for, so I'm calling this app a failure."

    "summary": "Amazon Fire fail",
    "reviewText": "Our biggest reason for using the Appstore was to share programs between my Droid RAZR & my Kindle Fire. Previously we used the Google Play (Market). Amazon content is repeatedly weeks, or months, behind Google's similar content. Often, in-app purchases are broken between devices on Amazon - such as the Cranky update which works on my Fire, but not on my RAZR. Amazon's technical support is horrible, telling me to reformat my phone (which I did) but it didn't make any difference. Now, Amazon makes you buy the same content twice for Fire vs. other Android devices - like Angry Birds Space or Cut the Rope Experiments, locking out programs from certain devices. (Therefore you must buy it twice, often at a higher price.)Overall, a VERY dissatisfied Amazon customer. We can't merge accounts, share content, etc. (Have a different account that has Prime on it, but can't bring them together!) As nice as the Fire was to begin with, the Appstore is part of the experience, and these major failures and the inability to Enterprise manage our devices means I will not buy more nor recommend them to others.After investing in the Fire, since I can't get at the content I need, my next step is now to start exploring how to root and re-rom the device, so that rather than using the Appstore I can get applications elsewhere. I feel very much like you have STOLEN from me, Amazon. You are changing the terms of our agreement after I have bought in. That doesn't seem to bother you either. It is NOT your right."

The police/fire feed for the county where that 90% of my daily commuting occurs provides valuable early warning about incidents on roads that traffic reporters would be telling me about far too late...if at all.Easy to use; search by name, genre or location, or search for any audio within a radius near you. Rock solid functionality on anHTC Evo 4gVery few differences between this and thefree version. Paid version drops ads, and adds a pause/play button that is persistent between sessions (and you can run the free and paid version at the same time to follow two programming sources)."

Make sure to turn off that music! I did find this challenging enough to want to keep playing for a while.While it is pretty fun, but I found myself frustrated with the controls as I would try to be going a certain direction but my finger had slid too far away from the control area and I would stop moving altogether.

    "summary": "Poor controls make this game play not enjoyable, an insult to the Pacman game!",
    "reviewText": "Posted at 8:53 AMGame Play:The game is very similar to the old Pacman game even to the point where you have a thumb joystick to move your action figure to run the maze and collect the dots. For me unfortunately the joystick is on the LH side of the game and I am right handed so the game is played with my most uncoordinated hand. There is a pause button on the top of the LH side of the screen.The controls take time to get used to and it is difficult at best in an open room to move the character to where you want it to go. You will find that for precise movements you must tap the joystick on the side of the direction you want to move in and it will move in one space increments. It is difficult to try to move precisely while trying to clear the maze and have multiple enemies fluidly coming after you while you struggle to get one colored dot. You have slid your thumb off of the area of the control you want to use and you move in the wrong direction. On my Kindle Fire a calibration screen said it was going to pop up but it never did. I could never find the calibrations screen again.There are dialogs that pop up on the screen while you are playing and the stop the game while you have to read the messages either from the yellow box or the leader of the characters chasing you. I find this to be distracting and not needed and you can turn them off in the options menu.When you get to a certain point in some levels you are playing you will unlock the red squares that chase you. In some rooms there are yellow boxes that you can push in front of the doors so that they cannot enter the room to get you. In other levels you are immediately trapped and you can get stung by one or two of the squares before you can even move. There are open square boxes in the wall of the maze and you can go into one of them and hide and they cannot see you. You can also push the yellow boxes and crush the red squares chasing you. In some levels later in the game there are so many red squares after you that you have virtually nowhere to run.Home Screen:* Start* Scores - takes you to their leaderboard* Options - adjust music, sounds, dialogs off/on and vibrations off/on* About - links to the web and social networkso Visit us - didn't work, it could not find their website.o Follow us on Twittero Become our fan on Facebook.What I like:A remake of the old Pacman games brings back old memories of a fun game. Unfortunately the controls are difficult to use and can be frustrating to find the right touch. I got to be OK at the game after a while but the main limiting factor with the game is the awkwardness of the controls. You may be better at it that I am.What I dislike:The controls of the game on my Kindle Fire are nothing but frustrating to try to use. You are trying to use a joystick to move through a maze while being chased by multiple red squares that are moving with fluid motion while you are struggling to change directions or to pick up a colored dot. It is difficult to make fine adjustments in your position until you get a better feel for the controls. The dot that is the joystick does allow you to make single block steps but while you are trying to get it to work you are being pursued by multiple red squares trying to kill you. It is just awkward.I turned off the popup messages that occur in the middle of the game as I found them distracting and not of value to the game play.I don't like the access to Facebook, Twitter and to the internet to their website. Connections to Facebook allow you to sign in via Facebook so you can challenge and compete against your friends without ever leaving the game. You can invite your friends by posting a link to your Facebook wall. View a list of your Facebook friends who play EVAC HD. Compare your high scores with those of friends on your leaderboard. You can even share your in-game achievements on your wall.The access permissions to the internet are for social networks and for access to the developer's web site. It could have been easily left out as it is unnecessary for those options to be in the app for me.The original Pacman had better graphics and was a lot more fun to play than this game. To compare this game to a classic is an insult to Pacman. This is a cheap knock off with poor graphics and extremely bad controls. This is another example of a developer trying to make money by copying someone else's game concept.Summary:I didn't enjoy this game at all. The poor controls take away from any possibility of enjoying the game play. You are not able to move your character fast enough to evade the many enemies you are facing and you get overwhelmed. The maze also contains a lot of hallways with one box and with one dot in it that forces you to stop, change direction, get the dot, reverse, stop, and change direction, all while being pursued by killer squares.With the present control concept and performance this game is not worth $1.99 and it should be free all the time.Size: 13.54MB uncompressed on my Kindle Fire.Permissions:* Network communication - full internet access* Storage - modify/delete internal storage contents* Network control - view network state, view WIFI state* Hardware controls - control vibrator"

I wont give any of the secrets away, but u can move stuff and trigger things and even get shockers that make the red squares(bad guys) freeze for a bit...( kind of like pac-man). There is only one thing I would change and that would be the controls. idk how I would improve them,but now they are abut hard and ive died a few times because of them. but besides that, this game is awesome!! #waybetterthanpac-man(;"

    "reviewText": "The game was attempted on Kindle Fire and Galaxy tab 10.1 and installed just fine. The graphics is pretty cool and while the controls can be slightly frustrating at times but still not that bad at all. The onscreen joystick can be moved to any location of your choice (By default it comes on the left side) which makes it easier to play the game.The objective of the game is to consume all the dots on the screen while you are navigating through the maze and avoiding the ghostly looking characters. It does have similarities when compared to classic PACMAN game which we all love so much.The game has no hidden modules and permissions are fine. But if you hate social media integration into android games then yeah those modules are annoying.EVAC HD is a fine game to have if you love classic PACMAN game."

    "summary": "Pac-Man: The Next Generation. Featuring unnecessary internet access, social media integration, and app store links",
    "reviewText": "Namco has countless times tried to re-invent Pac-Man and put it back into mainstream gaming, failing horribly.Hexage Ltd has succeeded where (many) others couldn't. Don't let the games clever description fool you, this is simply an HD remake of Pac-Man, with more features and a somewhat decent escape story.The object of EVAC HD is to eat all the dots (colors) you can, while navigating through the maze and avoiding ghosts (other blocks) that try to capture (eat) you. If this sounds like a game you played ages ago, that's because it is; but re-skinned and re-imagined for this generation.I absolutely love all the changes they made here. Adding little spaces for you to hide and avoid ghosts (I am not calling them \"reds\" like the game does) was pure genius, and the power ups add even more strategy to the classic dot gobbling.Side Note:There is a lot of false information floating around about EVAC HD's control scheme.It greatly upsets me when people just randomly spew off made up facts about the product they review based on somebody else's summary. Trust me on this, there is nothing wrong with the controls and you CAN indeed move the joystick to suit your orientation.The Good:- Tight controls. Contrary to some other reviewers, I love the way controls are handled here. I feel they are very good and had no issues whatsoever on two phones and two tablets (INCLUDING the Kindle Fire).- Classic Pac-Man gameplay brings back warm feelings of nostalgia.- Ingenious power ups allow you to do everything from stunning to destroying your captors.- Minor puzzle elements (moving blocks to open doors, blocking off ghosts, etc) add a bit of strategy to the action.- Awesome graphics. I am a sucker for this type of HD-Retro look.- Excellent soundtrack and effects. My only complaint is that no classic Pac-Man tunes made it into the game, but I am guessing the developers simply didn't want to get sued.The Bad:- Social media integration. Really, can we stop it with this crap please? I don't want my device posting that I beat a level and advertise for any game.- Links from within the game allow you to access the Google Play and Amazon store (and purchase things from there).- NETWORK permissions in a SINGLE PLAYER GAME.Open network sockets gives this app free range internet access.Access information about networks allows it to do just that (for both your phone and wireless networks).These things are just not needed in a single player game and are here just for the social media and link aspects of the app.While there is no traffic going to and from the game while it is just being played, hitting some of the other links makes the network monitor light up like a Christmas tree (obviously).- The game is incredibly short. Adding another campaign would go a long way to justifying the higher price point.- Higher price point. The game retails at $1.99 but is NOT YET worth that price in its current state.The Ugly:Thankfully I found nothing too terrible in EVAC HD.Scores:The Game: 5/5Permissions: 2/5 (single player games DO NOT NEED network permissions).Score: 3.5/5, bumping it up to 4/5 because Amazon does not allow .5 ratings, and because I thoroughly enjoyed this game.Conclusion:I am a sucker for HD remakes of classic games, even more so if they are actually good (as is the case here). While I simply can't recommend the game at its $1.99 pricing point, I suggest you grab it as today's free download.If you enjoy classic games, give EVAC HD a try, and if they ever add another campaign (more levels), or drop the price to $.99, or remove the unnecessary network permissions - I would even recommend purchasing it.Good job to the developers for actually improving on a classic. You guys (and gals) did great work here, but some of the things I mentioned are preventing me from giving it a perfect rating. Fix them, and I will bump it up."

    "reviewText": "I really enjoyed this at first, but eventually the non-intuitive and clunky controls made it impossible to move blocks or escape the red guys at a fast enough  pace.Another annoying thing was the messages from the evil guy would interrupt the game and put a modal dialog box on top of the screen which obscured the maze. You'd have to click to dismiss it and meanwhile you were interrupted in the middle of escaping from the red guys, and when the box went away you'd have to quickly figure out where you are and what you were doing. I lost a lot of life points because of this. They should have the boss's taunts appear in an area separate from the maze so it doesn't interrupt the game.Otherwise the game was fun, and the power-ups were a nice addition to Pac-man."

Not a problem for more modern devices or those with memory to spare but smaller or slower units will suffer.Overall, not that terrible if you don't mind the ads and the forced internet connection (both of which I despise), but might require that you watch the memory usage."

    "summary": "A satisfactory game with an odd scoring system",
    "reviewText": "Games like this are a dime a dozen, so for me the importance is in the details. I can find tons of sliding block games, but what has the best options and interface and has gone the extra mile to make it a stellar game? Unfortunately this game just doesn't really do that for me.The good:-Simple: I like that the blocks are actually blocks, not cars or any other objects. Keeping it simple is more up my alley with these types of games.-Options: The option to change the background and block texture is nice.-Stats: The stats button is handy to see how you're doing on various levels.-Difficulty options: It's nice to have 6 different difficulty options to progress through. Novice is nice for grade schoolers since it's pretty basic and easy.-Size and permissions: So many games are now asking us for some crazy, unnecessary permissions, this game isn't (only a storage permission). I appreciate that. It's also a manageable size (7MB installed).The bad:-Scoring: My biggest annoyance with the game is how moves are scored.  I noticed after my first few games that the move counter seemed way off, so I paid attention the next game and realized that it doesn't actually count how many times you move, it counts how many moves you move a piece out of its starting spot. So if you start with a 1 x 1 block and using only one swipe you move it all the way across the board 4 spots, your move counter will go up to 4 instead of 1. The flip side of that is if you move it back to its original spot the move counter will read 0. Odd! I mean, you could get a really low score sometimes if you remembered where every piece started and tried to get it close to its original position after you have the red box piece piece close to its goal.-No level select/overview: My other smaller gripes are the game seems very choppy, not very fluid. There's no main level select screen where you can see a little icon or something of all the 112 levels in a set difficulty with your stats. It's hard to go back through and try to get a better score on a level because a little left and right arrow at the bottom are the only way to move through puzzles in a set difficulty. Levels can also be skipped, so then again it's hard to see what levels have been skipped and go back to them. I actually prefer gameplay that doesn't allow for unlimited skipping, maybe one or two levels, but not being able to skip through as many as you want.-Menus: The menus aren't very intuitive. It's very odd that in the \"How to Play\" section the screenshots show different menus and screens than what's in the game. I like the screenshots better.-Missing components: While I would never use the feature, and actually prefer it not included, the tutorial mentions a \"heyzap\" network that you're supposed to be prompted to log into after solving  a certain number of puzzles. I think it's weird that it's mentioned and not actually in the game. It makes it seem like the game was haphazardly put together and missing pieces. I would rather they just delete that mention in the tutorial and leave out all social networking extras.Overall, for a FAOTD it's not too bad. If it were an app I was going to fork out cash for I'd be a little annoyed and feel kind of ripped off."

There really needs to be a reset button you do not have to dig through menus to find.  Also the reset button does not work right if you have finished the level.  It puts all the bricks back but does not return the red brick.  Finally the controls seem to be off because when I drag a block all the way across the field, i find i have run out of screen before I get the block half way across which means more moves since i have to lift my finger."

If you are in the middle of the \"novice\" section as an example, and would like to move to a different challenging level, nothing really happens if you tap the \"Menu\" item on my 8.9\" Kindle Fire.I picked this up for free as the free app of the day vs. it's normal price of $0.99 - for free, it's worth a shot, but save your buck once they start charging for it."

There are a lot of these types of games in the market as well as Amazon APP store which makes you move boxes and other objects to solve puzzles. This one does not really stand apart from anyone in terms of puzzle solving but I do like the simple interface and manageable small size app. There is no unwanted permissions and is worth the download if you like puzzles. The reason the rating falls on this game falls by one star is due to the way scoring is done. The game scoring system doesn't actually count how many times you move the blocks, it counts how many moves you move a piece out of its starting spot!!!! and counts less or more depending on where it ends up. This drove me nuts and I feel this needs to be fixed by the developer in the next update.For now, I am going to keep it in the cloud and wait for app update to try the game again later."

Sales ranges with a spread of $50 to $60k don't make any sense at all.  In new developments where new home prices are pretty much cast in stone, Zillow has &#34;Zestimate&#34; of up to $100k less!  My house, just as an example, has an appraised sale value of $289,900.  Zillow estimates the sales price to be $232,000.  My tax appraised value is $256,500. Go figure?

    "reviewText": "This app is rather hit and miss with its usefulness.  The date calculator is no doubt the most useful part of the app.  It can calculate the number of days or business days between two dates, or the date a certain number of days before or after a date.  There are a few instances where knowing the week number is important, but that functionality is built into the default Android calender.  The events list is useful, if you haven't already entered holidays into the Android calender.Less useful, but fun trivia nonetheless, is the \"About a date\" feature, that lets find all kinds of nifty information (On today's date in 1869, the Golden Spike was driven in Promontory Summit, Utah, completing the Transcontinental Railroad; Fred Astaire was born today in 1899, and Paul Revere died today in 1818), though all this app does is point your browser to the appropriate Wikipedia page.  There is also a list of months with a Friday the 13th, though again, you could just look at any calendar.This app includes 6 widgets, but the names aren't as obvious as they could be.  They are scattered all over the place as \"Current date\", \"Day of year\", \"Events\" and \"Events list\", and two for \"Week Info\".  The widgets are rather bland in appearance, and I'm not sure why Events needs to be 4 spaces wide, when a smaller widget would be more space efficient.There doesn't appear to be any way to enter events that repeat more often than annually, nor is there any way to add events that repeat on an unusual schedule (e.g., first Monday of September).The app comes with national holidays for a rather eclectic collection of 7 countries, including Norway, Switzerland, Austria and Singapore, but no support for Japan, Australia, the UK, Canada or Mexico.  I'd like to see a LOT more national holidays added (today is Mother's Day in Mexico and Constitution Day in Micronesia).  You can disable the holidays for any countries you don't care about.  You can also choose between Western or Orthodox Easter (or neither), though you can't have both, nor can you have both American and Canadian Thanksgiving.  There is no option for hiding religious holidays (e.g., Assumption of Mary).If the developer improves repeating events, and maybe adds a lot more countries to the events list, this app might be worth the 99 cents, but I'd hold off buying it until then.  Maybe next Bastille Day."

I saw something I didn't recognize in my drawer, so I pulled it down & tapped it to see what it was, it then tried opening a browser, but I wouldn't let it.I'm curious if this happens to others. If this happens to anyone else please post it in your review, I will check back.I will give it one more chance, if no other ads pop up, I'll keep it, but I'm very leery of it right now. I've had this android phone for over a year now and this is the first time this had happened.OK, I'm updating this a couple of hours later. I just picked up my phone to check a text and saw that another ad popped up.  So I never even opened/used this app.  I removed it.  Two pop-up ads within the first few hours of having it installed, without ever using it is too much for me.  If it ends up the ads were coming from someplace else, I'll edit this.I had trouble finding this app to remove it, I think I got it, instead of being called \"TKWeek\" it was called \"Week\" in Manage Apps."

My existing calendar on my computer adds in the American holidays or I can select which ethnic or country holidays I want to show including multiple selections.  This would have been a nice feature for this program.  In addition I have already programmed in the birthdays of my family and friends so I don't need to share my contact data.If you want more information about a holiday or a date this app simply links you to the Wikipedia web site that I could have gone to without this app.  There are multiple sites that will provide the history of a date as well as a list of local upcoming events you might like to attend.  If I have a WIFI to reach Wikipedia then I have one to go to a better site.  If you only going to provide a link to a web site like Wikipedia then you should allow the user to add in the web address of the site they would rather visit.Why do I care which months have Friday the 13th ?  You left out 12 holidays or events that American's recognize including Christmas but you count the days on the year that are on Friday the 13TH?  Overall I found that while this app seems to somewhat work, the data that I get from it is incomplete and/or linked to another site.  You should also list the following American events:* Flag Day June 14th* Father's Day June 17th* Labor Day September 3rd* Columbus Day October 8th* Election Day November 6th* Veteran's day November 11th* Christmas December 25th* Martin Luther King Day* Ground Hog Day February* Lincoln's Birthday  February 12* President's Day February* St Patrick's Day MarchHow could you forget Christmas?  1 Star!"

But the Devs are lazy and don't test their updates. My week widget used to say &quot;lune 6&quot; instead of June so I went looking for the app. there was an update and it fixed the problem. EXCEPT NOW ALL THE WIDGETS LOOK LIKE GIGANTIC STINKY DUNG AND THEY WERE THE ONLY COOL FEATURES OF THIS APP. Don't buy this app for a long while till these lazy Devs fix a lot of bugs. This was a free app so we the people could deal with all the bug tests the DEVS are too lazy to do. I'll check for an update for a week or so. If I find one that fixes this I'll keep it, and change this review. Till the day of the year widget looks good again 1 star. If I could give you less I would. HTC EVO 3D."

    "reviewText": "I'll start by saying this seems to be the best password keeper I've found.  The interface is relatively clean, and it's very configurable - it doesn't lock you into some developer's idea of which and how many fields each entry should have.  It uses higher-level encryption than any other program I've looked at, and it syncs with your desktop - something only one or two other apps do.  It's also relatively inexpensive with a one-time purchase fee instead of an annual subscription.That would all be great if it weren't for some pretty inexcusable drawbacks.  First, you can export your password list in order to move it to another device, but inexplicably the program exports to a completely unprotected .csv file!  It's not even an option, there's just no way to encrypt the exported file.  How you can develop a program that is designed to encrypt and protect data, then force users to export that data into a clear-text file is just beyond me.  Even worse is the fact that you can only connect to and sync data between your phone and computer if you install Apple's Bonjour service.  Are you kidding me?  This is what makes the app nothing but a bad iPhone port.  Hey guys - I bought an Android phone for a reason!  If I wanted to have to install Apple software on my computer I would have bought an iPhone!Bottom line is, no thanks. Don't force me to expose my password data if I need to export it, and don't force me to install Apple software to connect to an Android phone.  What a shame."

You have to be able to integrate wth an array of third party software, implement effective encryption, and sync easily between devices, all while showing your users you can be trusted.  It's no wonder so many are proprietary software or even monthly fees.It's a shame, then, that mSecure barely even makes an effort. It'll prefill your login forms on any browser... well, no, actually, just the stock one: no Miren, Dolphin or Firefox support here. It'll sync to your PC... if you buy additional software, which doesn't run on anything that's not Microsoft or Apple. It'll export your data for backup... in completely unencrypted form.  You have to take their word for it that they're keeping your data secure and not abusing it, because mSecure is proprietary software.The app is free today, but even today there are many better free options whose security and interoperability are better and easily verifiable by technical users. But even a GPG-encrypted text file is a better option for me than mSecure."

However, it's GUI is underwhelming and setting up a new type requires each and every field to be set up manually - not even a default 10 field setup or ability to copy from another form. Changing the type can result in lost fields. The copy/paste to feature is a bit wonky - but it's probably the fault of Windows or the FireFox browser."

Some mazes are a mine field of holes you have to negotiate around. Some mazes have multiple trickery objectives you can't access. Some mazes have plausible almost solutions. Don't be fooled! There is only one solution to each of these maps.If you are not good at judging the difference between one small gap and another, this is not the game for you. If you hate having to back out to start over because the ball is such in a made trap, this game is not for you. If you have hands that are in any way unsteady when you get nervous/angry/frustrated, this game will be hard for you."

Many of the mazes have openings that are just a wee bit too small to get the ball through, so you have to figure out the proper path in addition to avoiding the pitfalls. Most annoying however are the moving sections, which can make the difference between finishing in a few seconds and taking a minute or more to finish.The app also has OpenFeint, for those of you who don't like being spied on.I think $4 is far too much for this game. $2 would be a more reasonable price, if it were a bit more polished. In its current state, 99 cents would be appropriate.Works on the Evo 3D and the Xoom."

    "reviewText": "Well, I hope that developers of this app read this review and fix it. I have tried a few personal finance Android apps and really think that Easy Money is potentially the best app of this type on the market. However it's completely unusable in its  present form and here's why:1. Frequently force closes on attempts to add new transaction. I see from version history that each time developers report that they have fixed some \"force close\" issues but it is still there (as of 1.6.4 version).2. Currently EasyMoney supports only 2-level categories. When I attempted to export data from another app with multi-level category support, Easy Money reported that it had successfully exported 41 transactions (which is correct) but after that lost track of 3 transactions that were in sub-sub-categories. This is not a problem by itself (after all nobody promised multi-level category support), the problem is that instead of simply ignoring these transactions or reassigning them to some other category - Easy Money screwed up my entire database. It had added dollar values of those transactions to my total balance - yet transactions themselves were not visible and there was no way to see (and edit/delete) where those numbers came from. Had to reinstall everything.3. Errors in basic math. I had 2 credit card transactions, $160 an $10, and was surprised to see that my total balance was $150. At first I didn't believe it and checked for \"+\" and \"-\" signs, \"Depostit\" - \"Withdrawal\" checkbox in transaction description - everything was correct yet resulting balance was obviously wrong.To conclude: potentially it'a a winner but way too many bugs.PS: Samsung Vibrant, official Android OS 2.2.PPS: Now, almost 1 year after my initial review I'd like to update it and describe current state of affairs (as of Feb. 2012). My initial verdict was that this app has potential to become the best money-tracking app for Android but has some serious bugs. Not any more! Now I simply cannot express my anger with this app and developer(s). I have purchased it while it whas Amazon's free app of the day and what do I see?! I simply can not add transactions on my new AT&T; SGS2! After pressing \"Save & Done\" button no new transaction is being saved/created anywhere. App is absolutely useless now because I can not even add transactions!Sorry, devs, but I'm completely disillusioned about your product now. It's absolutely useless. There are other money-tracking apps on the market which just do what they are supposed to do."

    "reviewText": "This is a decent finance app for tracking your money and monitoring your budget if you don't mind manually entering in all your data. I currently use the Mint app which automates everything which for me is exactly what I need so I don't think I will make the switch to this app. Some people are not comfortable giving all their log in information to one app like Mint and for those folks this would be a great app.Overall the app functioned well but I did run into some issues where the app would force close when entering in transactions. This didn't happen a lot but it was frustrating when it did. There are a lot of catagories to choose from when creating your budget but I do wish each category had some sub-catagories to better define expenses. Some reviews mention that the app made errors when computing transactions but I never ran into that issue. The interface is slick and intuitive and overall it feels like a professional app.For free you should definitely check out this app if you are in the market for a finance tool. I do not think I could recommend this app at the normal 10 dollar price.EDIT: A commenter pointed out to me that you can create 1 sub-category for each category by following the instructions below. Perhaps the developer will add the ability to add even more sub-cateories since the functionality is built already.Under the Manage Categories (menu button first screen) you can add new categories, edit current categories. The feature is called \"Parent Category\""

I think this app would be helpful if I had tons of different accounts and wanted to have everything available quickly in one place, but I don't. Even if I did, I can't see why I would want to manually enter every single transaction into my phone when online banking or viewing statements online is free everywhere. It's easier for me to use Pageonce for my needs. I don't see why anyone would prefer this over any of the free money apps out there.

    "summary": "EasyMoney vs. Mint.com by Intuit",
    "reviewText": "I will update this review, as well as the Mint.com review (found in the Android Market), over time, as well as change star-ratings (if I feel the need), once I've had time to use both apps.  As of today (1/19/12), all I've done is install both apps (haven't even set them up yet).Some may ask, \"Why use both, especially when having to enter all the same data twice, once for each app?\"  The answer is twofold - first, to (personally) determine which is the better app.  I do not deny that whichever app proves best for me will also be the best for someone else, but, chances are, based on how I'll be testing, & comparing, the two, my end-result could, bet well, prove the best for most people.  The second reason is to sorta-kinda settle disputes between several reviewers.  Although there are several reasons for why reviewers say one app is better than the other (as reviewed for both apps, and as reviewed in both the Android Market & Amazon Appstore for Android), I will stick to pointing out what appears to be the three most prominent - entering data in one app is easier than the other (this applies to both apps, as reviewed by people), data can automatically be entered in one vs. having to manually enter all data in the other, & (supposedly) being required to enter all login info (username, password, account numbers, etc) for automatic data entry.  Next update (probably tomorrow) will include ease/difficulty of setting up both apps.Update (1/30/12):  Sorry the update took longer than expected, but I was on vacation.  Anyway, EasyMoney & Mint were both relatively simple to set up, although  both had their respective problems. With Mint, if one plans on entering multiple accounts, one (obviously) needs to know all the login information for said accounts.  I also discovered that certain types of accounts can't be entered for the app's auto-update feature, so, for any accounts that fall into such catagories, one must manually enter the data, exactly as you would with all data entered when using EasyMoney.  As for EasyMoney, to be quite frank, it's a PitA.  While setting up the app might be easier than Mint, maintaining it from that point forward isn't worth the time, or effort.  The one (and ONLY) feature that I like with EasyMoney is its ability for you to enter future bill payment information (name/company, date, amount, etc), and receive notifications when said bills are due to be paid.  Other than this one feature, I would avoid using EasyMoney, and stick with only using Mint.  Again, despite the fact that at least one previous reviewer blasted Mint for false beliefs that, by entering your personal banking login information, you were providing said info to an unknown person, the truth of the matter is, mint is from Intuit, a very well-known, and very well-respected financial services company, know for such products as Quicken, QuickBooks, and TurboTax.  If you can't trust Intuit, then you also can't trust your own bank, and you might as well take your money from the bank, and stuff it into your bed mattress.  Considering EasyMoney was the free download-of-the-day on the day i acquired it, the only...and I do mean only...reason I might (I haven't decided if it's worth the additional trouble) consider using it is for the bill payment reminder feature.  Of course, being that I (obviously) have an Android phone, and added to the fact that I use Outlook, I can just as easily enter the same info into either my phone's calender or Outlook, and have reminders appear in both.FINAL JUDGEMENT:  Between EasyMoney & Mint, I can only recommend Mint.  EasyMoney is too much of a PitA to use on an ongoing basis.  It requires you to not only manually enter every transaction (incoming, as well as outgoing, funds), but you are also required to manually select the transaction type.  Mint, on the other hand, not only automatically downloads all transaction data, but, in the majority of cases, it correctly selects the correct transaction type. I will admit that I have been a TurboTax user for many years, but, at the same time, I have never previously used Quicken.  With the full integration between Mint, Quicken, & TurboTax, that is another advantage that Mint has over EasyMoney.  As such, my original 4* rating for EasyMoney has been lowered to a 1* rating.  Initially, it appeared to be promising, but, in the end, it's anything but \"easy\"."

I am forced to fire up a task manager to kill the application.The other incredibly frustrating issue with the program is that, even after I have used a task manager to forcefully kill the app., the app. occasionally restarts itself in the background.Fix those two issues and it's a five star application."

I downloaded this app an hour ago, tuned to my favorite overseas channel and hopped in the shower. Admittedly it was a long shower but in 45 minutes I had to jump out, dry my hands, log into my phone, check the app, force start it, jump back in the shower and continue sudsing up, a total of 7 times. So you can see why I'm not enjoying this app. Sorry, but it's a big thumbs down and immediate uninstall.Maybe the next time the devs write another review they should be a bit more honest. one can wish!"

    "reviewText": "I have had this app less than three days, and thus have not had sufficient time to fully evaluate it to my complete satisfaction. Yet here we are, here I am, with a request from Amazon to rate this product. First...IT WORKS! But why shouldn't it? One assumes that these free apps have been tested before they are released. The sound quality is quite good, but that's more a function of the phone than the app itself. And so there we are. Perhaps, in six months or so, when I've used this app for a while, I may reevaluate it and update this review. And I may not. In my opinion Amazon needs to reevaluate its product review policies to allow users more time before they request and expect a review."

It can get very addictive, and thankfully the game remembers which levels you have completed.  The game has several levels of difficulty, with a load of maps for each.  Vibration is made use of as well, giving you the feel of playing on one of those old wooden games each time your ball knocks into a solid object.  Nicely done.What wasn't so nice was the very frequent pestering to sign up for this, that, or the other thing.  I get it, it's an ad support game.  Cool with me.  The little banner ad at the top of the screen was no big deal, but the repeated full screen nagging to subscribe to various mailing lists was *very* annoying and cost this game a couple stars.Controls - The game includes a calibration tool, and it seemed pretty accurate to me in judging how far and hard I was moving my phone around.  You can turn the vibration off if you're not into that, turn off the sound, and make a few other adjustments to tone the game's performance to more closely match your device's horsepower.Graphics - Graphics were very nicely rendered and flowed smoothly at the default settings.  If your device isn't up to it, you can tone the graphics down a bit, including going to 2D mode.Sounds - Basic and no background music.Stability & Performance - Game was stable and played smoothly.Extras - Open Feint, for recording your high scores and showing off."

The menu needs to be revamped with better style as there is too many things to press before one can start playing the game and is annoying.2. Most of the time the app does not seem to register taps on the menus (Tested on Kindle Fire)The game gets very challenging with lots of holes where the balls slides thru' Please make provisions for the ball to re-emerge somewhere else rather than starting from scratch it will make this app even more engaging and challenging.Please make some boards with different background colors as it might get more interesting to play rather than seeing the same color board every-time.Thanks for reading my comments."

My tablet isn't the most advanced one around, so I had to put the game on 2D mode - but once set there, this game was a pure delight to play. Plus, the boards get increasingly more difficult and there's even player-created boards you can download. All of these things are just plain wonderful.However... I also want to give this app one star. The ads are just ridiculous. Installing it is a nightmare of hidden \"skip\" buttons and attempts to make you sign up for sponsored mailing lists and adware. VERY annoying - and I can't even express how much that \"VERY\" needs to be in huge, bold letters.The sad thing is that this developer doesn't need to sink to that kind of level to sell their game. It's a darn good game that could easily sell itself. Instead, I find myself conflicted on what to do here. Part of me wants to buy the ad-free version to support a game I find very enjoyable... but mostly, I find myself not wanting to \"reward\" a developer for using such downright annoying methods to try to sell their game.To be honest, the ads here are making me NOT buy a game I would otherwise have happily paid for. I just can't condone this kind of obnoxious advertising practice."

    "reviewText": "This game was a lot of fun.  I didn&#8217;t have much success shooting down the birds or the planes, but I loved making the plane fly loop-d-loops.  I also loved flying the plane up toward the stratosphere and outer space (you could tell you are getting too high when the light fades and the sky darkens) and dropping straight down to force a stall.  Once in a stall I would see how close I could get to the ground (and crashing) before I pulled up.  Fun.But while it was fun I had some issues.  My biggest complaint about this game was the placement of the dial that controlled the plane&#8217;s movements.  It was on the left side of the screen, and there was no option to switch it to the right.  As a right handed person I found this cumbersome.  I blame my lack of shooting precision on the placement of the dial and not on my horrible hand-eye coordination.I also had issues with the &#8220;sensitivity&#8221; settings.  I varied it from lowest to highest and I didn&#8217;t notice much of a difference.  It seemed to be stuck on super-sensitive where any little movement of my thumb would send the plane into loops.In playing this game I found that there wasn&#8217;t enough horizontal space to maneuver in.  I could only fly horizontal for a few seconds before I reached the end of the screen and had to turn around.  I was playing on a 7&#8221; Kindle so maybe this isn&#8217;t an issue on larger devices.So a game with lots of potential, but I wouldn&#8217;t try it again until the dial to control movement could be place on the right."

I have used calorie counting programs in the past and find that, on a short-term basis, they are useful to track the actual number of calories you are eating in a day vs the number of calories you'd like to think you are eating.This app - I would maybe use it on a computer, but not on my Kindle. I have already had difficulties finding 2 out of 3 items I wished to add to daily list. I tried the barcode feature and was unable to find any of the items I inputted, even after modifying a few times thinking maybe I'd entered the number wrong. I wasn't finding an easy way to enter partial servings or, say, the milk I added to my tea. And the calorie count goal they gave me was completely unrealistic (1200 calories a day for an active individual who exercises 45+ minutes a day at a reasonable level of activity?? I am not trying to be rail thin, just lose a few pounds.).It seems like it could be a useful app for individuals with only a limited idea of the calories they are actually consuming in a day/folks who needed a little bit of added motivation. However, if you already pay attention to labels, skip this."

It is just an entry without a result.  Oddly, it does list and count the results of carido exercises.  Frustrating.So I stopped using it.AD2"

Anyways very disappointed because I couldn't even set up an account on my kindle I had to use a friend's laptop and then I thought if I downloaded it again and put in my info it would let me in, but no such luck!!!!! Very disappointed and a big waste of time. I went to the lose it app and it pretty much does the exactly same thing my fitness pal does except &quot;lose it&quot; actually works"

While the app will subtract calories burned during cardio it does NOT do so for strength training which only serves to proliferate the myth that in order to be skinny you should be doing hours of cardio. LOOK AROUND THE GYM, LADIES...THE HOTTEST BODIES ARE NOT SLUMPING THRU 10 MILES ON THE TREADMILL. THEY ARE LIFTING WEIGHTS. HEAVY WEIGHTS. YOU LACK THE TESTOSTERONE TO &quot;BULK UP&quot; LIKE A MAN. THAT IS ONE OF THE MOST DAMAGING MYTHS IN FITNESS HISTORY! not only do you burn just as many calories while lifting but UNLIKE cardio, you continue burning at a higher rate for the rest of the day. And too much cardio? yeah...that actually will stop your thyroid from producing T3....which will effectively shut down your metabolism. dont believe me? Google it."

Reinstalling didn't help, just proved it wasn't' t a different app making my kindle so herky-jerky. Too bad, because the update was otherwise a real improvement, making the interface more intuitive and fixing some of the more frustrating aspects of using the food database. I hope they work out the bugs soon. My husband has no problems with it on his iPod."

It is a comparatively large ap (one of the biggest of the 50 odd aps I have on my tablet) and could cause problems for people with low ram or a slow processor.  If you use it all the time, if it is one of the primary uses of your device then maybe that's OK (i.e. it isn't taking resources from something else).Even so, it is something to be aware of.  I stripped it off my tablet after 2 days because I grew tired of having to shut it down whenever I turned on my device... and wanted to use it for something else (and I have about the fastest processor available now on mobile devices), and a lot of ram.  It is not a problem unless I am running another program which needs a lot of memory, but why have a memory hog running in the background?  This service is not that much more convenient then others, not enough to where I think it is worth the amount of (disk) space it demands, or the memory load.  Add to that what is effectively spyware (why would it be running in the background if it is not monitoring & reporting as you agreed to allow when you installed it).  Personally I do not think the package is worth what it costs in terms of system lag... but that is a personal thing.  If you do a lot of uploading and this service is your primary means of sharing pictures then it could be worth it to you.  If your system is suddenly laggy, use something like taskill to turn it off."

This game is great to me because you win, but if you don't it's a buy chips with your credit card game.  It also sells you other games which I took the free dls of, bingo and video poker since I won so much on this one.  But it's just another show up every day and then pay to play game.

As soon as you go up the amount of bet above $10, you will see that you are always at a huge disadvantage! The intent is very obvious: to bankrupt you quickly so you may buy chips from them. Instead of playing blackjack, you are blackmailed! Screw it, I will never spend a penny on this wicked program.The only good thing is to train you the basic strategy with the smallest bet, but for that purpose, there are plenty of good apps doing much better training job.The U I is good."

I like to bet higher for the fun of it, but if I lose quickly, I'm pretty much done for the day. That part is annoying. Otherwise, it's your basic Blackjack game."

Harmless fun.  Maybe a &#34;quick addition&#34; game for kids vs. flashcards ;)."

Obviously I was mistaken, and uninstalled it both from my cell phone (smart phone or android or whatever you all want to call it) AND my FIRE Kindle. I cannot play a free game and then a pop up comes on and will not allow you to play again until a large amount of money is paid. I understand that we cannot play on LOVE!!! but for us that cannot afford to pay for simple games, then it should NOT be advertised as FREE. It is a paying/subscriber app and should reflect that rather than being a giant surprise."

Seesmic asks for fine GPS data but does not seem to access the low level system logs that Tweetcaster sees, according to the product description.2. I do like the dark grey theme of Tweetcaster, its ZipIt feature, list creation within the app, and the choice of URL action. Also, it is easier to tell if something's been retweeted in Tweetcaster and by whom, as long as you recognize the RT'er's logo.As others have noted, you can post to FB but not read others' posts. I keep hoping Tweetdeck desktop's features will be replicated in this app, too."

When you pick the correct answer it continues to display in tiny font near the edge of the cell; either high or low or left or right.  At a glance, it's very difficult to see which cells you have filled in because of the offset placement and tiny font.  With my visual learning orientation this was so cumbersome that I solved one puzzle and removed the app from my Kindle Fire device.  IMHO - if you're over 40 find a different Sudoku app before you go blind.  I like my optometrist, but only want to visit once per year."

Don't care for the background &amp; they could spice it up more as far as looks. I feel that it would be easier if the numbers were on the top instead of the bottom but that's just where I prefer them. Wish that u could go right to the score webpage instead of just getting a brief flash of where to go. Also could make the &quot;Easy&quot; &quot;Hard&quot; etc buttons more spread out &amp; larger. Other then those little issues its a pretty good game."

    "reviewText": "Test device: Samsung Epic, Android 2.2If you for some reason love the format of those photo booths typical seen around arcades and other amusement spots, you might like this app.  It's stable and spits out pics in strips, just like the real world booths do.  You can change up the configuration a bit to add minor effects, all of which are pretty typical for any photo app.  In app sharing is right there, so you can send your newly minted strip along to whatever shares you already have installed on your device.  There is a quick switch button to swap which camera you're using, front or back.Besides the lackluster effect options, a couple other things bugged me about the app.  First, it doesn't save the strip in a standard location on your device.  I hunted it down though, verifying that it does at least save the images to the SD card.  Second, it didn't trigger a rescan of the SD card so that the strip would be added to my picture gallery.  I had to do this manually to get the image to show up with all in Gallery and Photovault.  And third, no Help section whatsoever, but has ads for other services like renting a photo booth.Bottom line, is it worth the (current) $2?  No, not at all.I hope you find this information helpful.  If not, feel free to leave comments/questions."

I've yet to get the flash to work at all, and despite it having the option fort the front camera it never worked.All in all it feels like an app that was never fully tested and was never ready for release.It really should be called a beta."

    "reviewText": "I haven't seen this app on another tablet, but on an Android Honeycomb 3.0 it doesn't interface well with the camera.  The app has a picture frame for the user to use as a reference for positioning the picture about to be taken. I tried to take my own picture using the back camera and had to wave the tablet around in an effort to try to position my face in the picture frame.  My face remained illusive and hard to get into the frame.It would be like being in a photo booth and the people sitting on the bench would have to move all around trying to get their faces/bodies to appear in the mirror.I really wanted the app to work so I tried again and again and finally got a good picture strip to share with friends and family.  I did it by focusing my face in front of the camera and assuming it was in the picture frame - which is was on the final picture strip.  This is disappointing because it takes away some of the photo booth experience which is having fun seeing the faces being made as the picture is being taken.I gave Photo Booth 3 stars because in the end I have a fun picture strip to share.  It may be, as it is with many apps out at this time, both iPhone and Android platform, that the app was written for a phone versus tablet and that is why it doesn't work as intended on a tablet which is larger than phones.I'll edit this in the future if I find all of this just turned out to be related to a user learning curve."

The picture taking interface stays in portrait mode when taking picture regardless of device orientation. Having checked the settings for something to fix that, I found that the settings screen can display in landscape but no such option. The app easily switches between the front and back camera as well but both are placed on the device expecting landscape usage. Even having the option to rotate the picture while staying portrait mode might be preferable. While taking pictures is not ideal on this device, it does work and it's more ideal than using phone my which has no front facing camera. The developer shouldn't have too much difficulty fixing this minor issue however they decide to and if they want to.  I'm hopeful for update soon."

    "reviewText": "Overview: Pocketbooth does exactly what you'd think, it takes 3-4 pictures in succession and puts them into a photobooth style grid. There's a few effects, and you can customize the color of the frame and the amount of time between shots.Pros: It makes this process extremely easy, so for a lot of people this could be a lot of fun. More interesting to share 4 pics of something similar in this fashion, almost like a comic strip. And taking a bunch of pictures with your friends is definitely a good time. It's simple, and easy to use, so for all of that it's not a bad app to have. After your picture is ready, you can share it to whatever you'd like(facebook, twitter, email, messaging, etc).Cons: The real con here is there's not enough here to justify spending $2. Any other day of the week this thing costs way too much money for what it does. There's a few apps that do this for $1(Spark Booth Mini), a couple that do it for free(PhotoBooth). And a lot of full-fledged camera apps, like camera zoom, that will do this and a hell of a lot more for a couple dollars more. Not that many effects, and you can't change the template of the grid. 4 pics in a row is ok, but having different layouts would at least add some dimension to this app. This outputs a jpg that is 489 x 2608, which isn't bad, but you have no control over the resolution.Should you buy? Quickly put, no. Don't pay money for this. If doing this straight from your phone is necessary, grab it today. At this point, most people can just throw these together on their computers using photoshop and a number of other applications, having way more control over the result..If you missed out on having it for free, still want the convenience of doing it straight on the phone, don't waste your time or money. Grab Photobooth on the app market and enjoy it for free.Phone: Droid X (Android 2.2.1, Liberty 2.0.1)"

There is no autoplay option, and the buttons to turn the page are tiny little cresent moons which my toddler cannot consistently manage on her own. There are very few interactive parts of the page, and none of them relate to the words on the page. Some books highlight the word as they are read, or have pop up words when you click around the page. This encourages literacy and draws a pre-reader to notice the letters and words they are hearing. Not this app.The images are pretty, but laid out terribly. On every page, there is a huge open empty space in the middle and all the images are crowded around the edges. This makes it harder to click on individual objects for chubby little fingers, and just isn't very nice to look at for a parent.Overall: save your money and get a better book."

    "reviewText": "PLEASE READ:  DOES THIS SOUND LIKE \"BANK LEVEL SECURITY?\"  I AM RECEIVING EMAIL WITH LINKS INTENDED FOR ANOTHER CUSTOMER NAMED \"SHARMONIQUE\"!!!!!!!__________________________________SUNDAY, OCTOBER 16, 2011, 1:00 PM:__________________________________PAGEONCE has signed me up and installed the Beta BillPay program module into my account even though I DID NOT AGREE TO IT in the survey email they sent!  The \"survey\" stated (at the end) \"put your name and email address in and click 'send' to join the Beta program.\"  I NEVER DID THAT AND I BACKED OUT OF THE EMAIL! I AM VERY CONCERNED because today, SUNDAY, October 16, 2011, I received an email from PageOnce that began \"DEAR SHARMONIQUE...\" and my name IS NOT SHARMONIQUE.  I immediately emailed PageOnce at the email address given because of my concern with someone else's email being sent to MY email address with LINKS in it to activate the BillPay!  A few minutes later, I decided to open MY PageOnce account, and LOW AND BEHOLD, it goes RIGHT TO THE MAIN SCREEN just like usual (not notices, install, nothing!!) WITH NO DOWNLOADING ON MY BEHALF OF ANYTHING, nothing.... then as usual, I click on the little square that shows you the bills coming due.  And then I noticed something to my HORROR..... Next to each bill listed was a little green icon that you could click that said \"PAY.\" I couldn't BELIEVE THIS! NOW I HAD THE BETA BILLPAY PROGRAM INCORPORATED INTO MY NORMAL PAGEONCE ACCOUNT AND NEVER GAVE PERMISION FOR THAT TO HAPPEN!  I tried to be a nice person and answer their survey they sent by email several days ago, which asked what features you \"would\" like should a bill pay program be available, and I STOPPED AT THE VERY END OF THE SURVEY WHERE IT SAYS \"PUT IN YOUR EMAIL ADDRESS AND NAME TO SIGN UP FOR A BILLPAY PROGRAM WHEN IT BECOMES AVAILABLE.\"  I backed CLOSED THE EMAIL (AND, HENCE, THE SURVEY) AND NEVER AGREED TO JOIN THE BETA PROGRAM.  And here it is, several days later, I get SOMEONE ELSE'S EMAIL WITH LINKS IN IT TO ACTIVATE BILLPAY addressed to a person THAT IS NOT ME.  Why did PageOnce SIGN ME UP when I never gave persmission?  Is Sharmonique's account now MINE?  And does SHE now have MY ACCOUNT??I CALLED IMMEDIATELY TO THE TOLL-FREE NUMBER FOR PAGEONCE this morning as soon as I saw my app had BILLPAY ON IT with, AT A GLANCE, had MY FULL ACCOUNT NUMBERS ON THE BILLS.  A Ms. Kelly Forth answered the phone.  She was interested in only getting my phone number to \"escalate\" the problem to Tech Support, even though I asked her AT LEAST 10 TIMES what PageOnce can do AT THIS MOMENT to PROTECT MY ACCOUNT from access should ANOTHER PERSON now have access to MY ACCOUNT. I asked what PageOnce does when there is a possible breach in security, and could she find out who Sharmonique is and whether there was an email sent to HER meant for ME, or can she or someone else freeze my account from third-party access or SOMETHING TO PROTECT ME NOW!!!!  She kept repeating the same canned response repeatedly that it's \"a Sunday\" and all she could do is write up a report and escalate it and someone would get back to me IN 48 HOURS and to give her my phone number for tech support.  So, because \"it's a Sunday...,\" PageOnce has NO ABILITY (at least during MY phone call!) to check into a possible security breach and would only \"get back to me in 48 hrs).... They actually want up to 48 hours to do something about this!  Ms. Kelly Forth kept insisting that my \"account was \"safe\" because \"BillPay and PageOnce are two different accounts.\"  HUH?  I DON'T HAVE A BILLPAY ACCOUNT OR SEPARATE PROGRAM!  THE BILLPAY IS INTERTWINED INTO WHAT WAS MY PLAIN OL' PAGEONCE APP WITH NO WAY TO SEPARATE THEM!!!  I insisted over and over again that how could that be when I now have BILL PAY INCORPORATED INTO MY PAGEONCE ACCOUNT/APP AND HAVE NO WAY OF REMOVING IT EVEN THOUGH I ASKED FOR THAT TO BE DONE IMMEDIATELY, AND WAS DECLINED ANY FURTHER CONVERSATION ABOUT HOW TO PROTECT MY ACCOUNT N-O-W!!  I even asked Ms. Kelly Forth whether it was advisable for me to DELETE THE ACCOUNT in order to protect it, and would it be possible if she can surely tell me that Sharmonique does not at this point ALSO have access to my account!  And she would not say ANYTHING except \"the only thing we can do is report it and take your phone number for someone to call you back in 48 hours...\" over and over and over, with NO SOLUTION OTHER THAN THAT LAME ONE.  I can't even decide whether deleting it myself is proper because now if someone else has my account information, then I HAVE NO WAY TO GET BACK IN TO MY OWN ACCOUNT TO PROTECT IT OR CHANGE PASSWORDS OR ANYTHING, ESPECIALLY TO SEE THE ACTIVITY ON THE ACCOUNT, and possibly a THIRD PARTY DOES!!  SO NOW I AM STUCK NOT KNOWING AS OF THIS MINUTE WHAT I SHOULD DO, WHY I GOT THE EMAIL FROM SOMEONE ELSES BILLPAY ACCOUNT ACTIVATION, AND WHO GOT MINE!!  OR WHY THEY HAD THE AUDACITY TO SOMEONE ON THEIR END \"INSTALL\" THE BETA BILLPAY INTO MY PAGEONCE ACCOUNT WITHOUT NOTIFYING ME OR ANYTHING!  AND I NEVER EVEN CLICKED ON ONE LOUSY LINK IN \"SHARMONIQUE'S EMAIL\" which WAS the email to confirm that I WANTED THIS!  SO HOW DID THE BILLPAY GET IN THERE WITHOUT MY PERMISSION OR INSTALLATION?? I CLICKED ON NOTHING ANYWHERE TO PERMIT THIS!  OH! One other thing I noticed.... when I was in MY PAGEONCE APP, to get OUT of it, I clicked the backup button on my android (as you would normally do to back out of something.... AND THERE WAS A WHOLE SCREEN WITH A NEW LOOK TO IT THAT SAID \"PAGEONCE BILLPAY BETA\" on it with TWO HUGE CLICKABLE BUTTONS UNDER THE \"LOGO\".... ONE WAS TO ACCEPT AND THE OTHER WAS TO DECLINE!  BUT it DISAPPEARED IN 2 SECONDS AND went RIGHT BACK TO THE PAGE YOU NORMALLY GET WHEN YOU SIGN IN.  I tried it AGAIN.... WENT IN.... BACKED OUT... and the screen flashed VERY QUICKLY and DISAPPEARED AGAIN!!! Now explain to me... WHY WOULD THE APP HAVE A DECLINE/ACCEPT feature on a \"new main screen\" if you have to SIGN UP FOR THE BETA PROGRAM OTHERWISE only AFTER you have already installed the normal PageOnce without BillPay????  What kind of a trick is THIS? And when would THAT screen have come into play? Why didn't I GET THAT SCREEN WHEN I FIRST SIGNED IN? Because it BYPASSED IT ON PURPOSE when I first signed in, that's why! I only saw it when I BACKED OUT of PageOnce and guess I \"tricked\" it into showing me what SHOULD have been or was SUPPOSED to be the new \"first screen\" of the app IF IT HAS BILLPAY BETA INSIDE IT!  WHAT KIND OF TRICKERY IS THIS? IS THIS THE KIND OF COMPANY THEY EXPECT US TO TRUST ALL OF OUR PERSONAL DATA WITH ON A DAILY BASIS... WHEN THEY RESORT TO TRICKERY AND DECEPTION JUST TO GET YOU TO BE ONE OF THE MANY GUINEA PIGS THEY NEED FOR THE BETA PROGRAM?MY QUESTION TO YOU PEOPLE WHO HAVE DOWNLOADED OR ARE THINKING ABOUT DOWNLOADING THIS PROGRAM IS:  DOES THIS SOUND LIKE \"BANK-LEVEL SECURITY\" TO YOU?????  If this were MY bank, I'D FIRE IT!!  I AM THOROUGHLY DISGUSTED AT THE LACK OF THE ABILITY OF PAGEONCE TO REACT TO A POSSIBLE SECURITY BREACH BECAUSE \"it's a SUNDAY.\"  PERHAPS INSTEAD OF HAVING MS. KELLY FORTH WORK ON A SUNDAY just to take phone calls from what she says is Los Altos, IT MIGHT HAVE BEEN BETTER FOR PAGEONCE TO PAY A TECH SUPPORT PERSON TO BE ON CALL JUST IN CASE SOMETHING GOES TERRIBLY WRONG WITH THE BILLPAY BETA PROGRAM AND GOES HAYWIRE SENDING OUT INFORMATION ON THEIR CUSTOMERS TO OTHER CUSTOMERS and WORRIES THEM SICK TO DEATH!?!?I WILL CONTINUE TO POST UPDATES ON PAGEONCE'S RESPONSES (EMAIL, PHONE, ETC.).... AS they come in... or IF they come in..... and this is what I told Ms. Kelly Forth I would be doing on the App markets review sites UNTIL I HEAR FROM THEM and GET THIS RESOLVED WITH AN EXPLANATION IN WRITING._____________________________________________SUNDAY, OCTOBER 16, 2011, 4:00 PM......UPDATE_____________________________________________Nothing. NO WORD.  And poor SHARMONIQUE, WHERE ARE YOU?  And do you know what's happening?  AND THE MILLION-DOLLAR QUESTION:  WILL YOU BE TOLD EMAIL INTENDED FOR YOU went to ME.... or will they keep that from you?  And to others who have this program.... will you even know that email intended for you WENT TO ANOTHER PERSON?  WHAT'S NEXT? WHAT KIND OF GLITCH?  Do we find out the hard way when someone gets access and pays their bills with OUR ACCOUNTS?  All this was said to them on the phone today, but as you know, it's \"a Sunday.\"......Stay tuned for further updates....UPDATE.... PLEASE CLICK ON COMMENTS TO MY REVIEW TO SEE THE UPDATE.  I POSTED IT THERE."

    "reviewText": "I have been using this app for a few months now to track my cardio workouts.  I like the interface and the way you can record your workouts easily and can view them online.  I think it is a fantastic app and would have given it at least a four star rating except that the GPS function is very spotty for my phone.  I have an HTC EVO 4G and no matter what GPS sensitivity I put the app at, my GPS signal seems to always go out.  During my last 60 minute run around my neighborhood, every time I looked at the app, the GPS was searching for a signal and was not able to tell me my speed, or distance, or where I was.  I think during the entire hour-long run, the app updated my position about a dozen times total, so instead of accurately tracking a 60 minute, six mile run, the app tells me that my average speed was 7.8 mph, and only went 4.1 miles.  The map was also highly inaccurate since the GPS dropped out so much.  I don't think it's my phone, since my GPS works with Google Maps even inside my own house, and I even downloaded JogTracker whose GPS worked perfectly even in my pocket during the run!  CardioTracker's GPS would not even get a strong signal when I was walking at a 2.5 mph pace while holding out my phone at arm's length (I feel really goofy when I do this while running).So now, CardioTracker only serves as a cardio workout log app for me, and I use JogTracker to accurately track my outdoor runs' pace, distance, etc.  It's too bad because I really want CardioTracker to work because I like being able to choose my music within the app and I think the calorie burned estimate for me is pretty accurate.  I hope this is a bug and not my phone and can get fixed in a future update.  Are there any other EVO 4G users out there with similar problems?"

It sounded like it had more features that could be useful.I was correct about the features but the interface it TERRIBLE. The homescreen is extremely confusing and advertises a lot of other apps for you to download. You would think that since these are all part of the same set (the widget and Calorific) that they would integrate into the program, but that's not the case. If you click on the different programs it always asks if you want to download the same program you already own...Besides that, it's just very difficult to use. It takes almost an hour to set everything up if you download all of the add-ons. MyFitnessPal is just easier to use. The only thing I really like about this program is that when you finally figure out how to begin an exercise it has an integrated music app."

I have to rotate the screen to get the right number in.

Certain parts of the app works fine - the movie showtimes, the reviews, etc.  But its the video streaming and the loading of the video library that causes the crash.  I'm fairly confident it's the app and not my machine because no other apps have crashed.Frankly, I'm not totally surprised by this - Flixster has a poor track record in my opinion.  It's always slower than other apps and I even have trouble with it on my laptop sometimes.  I'd be curious to hear if anyone else is having trouble with this app on the Kindle Fire?For Ultraviolet users: Unfortunately, at the time of this review the Kindle Fire does not support apps for Vudu, CinemaNow, or any other streaming service compatible with your Ultraviolet account.  So if you have a UV locker, then Flixster is your only option for accessing movies on the Kindle, and if it doesn't work then you're out of luck."

I downloaded a movie so I can watch it over a 6hr flight I was on and I was unable to watch the downloaded movie and the plane did not have Wi-Fi. Not being able to watch the movie totally defeats the purpose of purchasing movies with a digital download if I can only stream it through devices.  The only good thing about the app is getting movie times for local theaters and streaming. The other features, connecting to Netflix, Facebook, etc are useless and don't do anything but link everything together which makes no sense. If I cant watch downloaded movies soon I will unistall the app."

I got it because it claimed to record audio. I was hoping to record a program on a webcast, from my chromebook, which has it as a Chrome app. (That may be a factor in the functionality). It was a difficult journey to find where go record audio at all. Once I actually recorded the audio, there was no way to save it, except to post it on Facebook. I'm grateful I had the sense to record the webcast from my android via evernote, just in case. Also, within minutes of creating an account to access this rather pointless app., I was notified that some creepy guy was following me on it and I started getting spam scammer emails. I do not recommend this application."

    "reviewText": "It's an \"alright\" app if you like these kinds of games. Graphics arent the most stellar. Music and sound, as well as vibration, CAN be turned off. Its \"acceptable\" in the accuracy department.  But what makes this app annoying is NO EXIT BUTTON when you want to CLOSE IT.  Players should not have to back out of the game, only to then have to go to Settings, Apps, Manage Apps, scroll to find Bonsai, click it, scroll down to press Force Close, then back out of that until you hit the desktop again.  If I want to fiddle with 3 or 4 games when I have 20 mins to spare waiting somewhere, and ALL the games did this, Id have several of them sucking up phone memory all day unless I performed this Force Close routine!  If Im in a doctors office, and they call my name, I should be able to EXIT immediately and not have to annoy other people while I say \"wait until I back out of BONSAI and screw with the Application setting so I can CLOSE this app\"  Makes it so this is the app I WOULDNT whip out with a few mins to spare!  Thats why its a one star app after the appropriate star deductions, because I wouldnt use it as a time-killler app. Thats what most little diddy games like this are used for anyway, and now that has changed.  Put an EXIT BUTTON in, and I'll adjust accordingly.  It was a three star app without this oversight, so I took off 2 stars because I wont play it before I play others that DO have the courtesy of including the exit button.  Note: I played 3 levels, so dont yet know if it will start acting screwy after playing more levels, like some mentioned."

The recipes themselves are the unhealthiest of anywhere on the internet. I checked out the diabetic section of recipes: low and behold, there was salt in every recipe. SALT! For diabetics, salt is a death sentence.  Isn't anyone at recipe search watching these recipes for health? Three of four recipes were either starchy, carb-laden potatoes or some sickeningly sweet dessert guaranteed to send one into a diabetic coma.Recipes in the general selection were not much better.  Each recipe was a disaster for health, fitness and every doctor's worst nightmare. They are filled with butter, fats, highest starchy, carb-laden foods imaginable. Most were not even recipes, rather, directions or instructions for assembling pre-made and overly processed foods. No wonder America is the fattest nation on earth. I cannot state  enough bad words about these recipes. Guaranteed to raise blood pressure, diabetes, risk of heart attacks, stroke and so on.This app should come with a health warning! Uninstalling and warning others."

However, it has one flaw that's extremely difficult to ignore as it's a vital feature of any email app: I can't send emails.I was able to send a test email just fine, but since then if I start writing an email I get booted to a different screen after a few seconds. I spent about ten minutes trying to reply to an email this morning before just giving up and going to Outlook on my PC, which I was hoping this app would negate the need for."

I installed it and waited until I was somewhere quiet to watch the video.  I adjusted the settings over and over and over again.  But I keep finding my phone active in my pocket.  That's just not gonna work.  As for saving battery life, I already keep my phone at 15 second timeout, so Screebl ended up wasting my battery, not saving it.  In theory, I could set the \"on\" parameters to be so narrow that I would have to work hard to keep the phone in that position, but I swear that my pocket would find a way to carry my phone that way.  Uninstalled.Two stars.  One for presentation and one for effort."

Maybe it's one of those fake sales, put up a high number, than give it away for free to make people think it's better than it is. Like I just got some kind of bargain...If this was a free game, i'd be rating it way differently. It's ok for what it is, a simple block breaker game with a ship that shoots missiles at you the whole time on each level. This game set mobile gaming back 10 years though, what the heck is up with the price. I'm not going to waste my time doing an in depth review of this. It's not worth it, not even a little. If you love love love brick breaking games, then grab it today. But even as far as brick breakers, it's only mediocre. Honestly, don't waste your time on this one.Phone: Droid X(2.2.1)"

If you pause the game for help, you'll soon find your SOL. It's almost like they tried to hide the main menu from you. If you go back to the homescreen and press the menu button you'll find your instructions, options, and high-score boards.The default control layout is silly, forcing you to awkwardly hold your phone at an angle or cover half your screen. If you navigate your way to the options menu, you can change the shooting buttons position to the lower right-hand side of your screen, however that only fixes half of your problems. For some reason, both aiming and propulsion is done from the same joystick, meaning that in order to aim at an enemy... you have to fly straight at them.Graphics are meant to look retro... but they look like they were actually designed nearly 30 years ago rather than looking like a nice tribute to the graphics of yesteryear. They're also quite bland, excluding the nice backdrop the game has. Music and sound effects are likewise. Retro... yet bland.The most obnoxious part about this game was that it would not close! I even used the exit button from the hidden menu, but after many minutes had past, the background music was still playing on my phone even though I was now staring at my homescreen. I reopened the app, navigated to the menu, and hit exit again... and the same thing happened; and kept happening until I went to my phone settings and force-stopped the application.Overall, and underwhelming and annoying experience. If you can get it for free, might as well try it out, but if it's no longer the free app of the day, take your money elsewhere! There's plenty of better shooters on Android.-1 for poor menu design-1 for bland graphics/music-1 for poor controls and default setup-1 for not closingFor more of my game/app reviews and the full review for Sinister Planet, look! me up at exm.nr/anthony-orale, I almost always do an extensive review of the free app of the day!"

If this had Game Gripper support or just remappable keyboard controls, I might have even been tempted to pay for it. As it is, with my two thumbs covering part of the screen, I'm just glad it's free today.The menu system is confusing.

The second time I clicked on Paper Toss, a weird yellow text box showed up for about 1 second and then some kind of a Hamster game started and was asking me to login with my email address and all.  I stopped it and started it again, same thing.  I deleted the app - at least it seems like I did, I am very unsure of my whole Fire now, I should probably reset it to the factory settings and start over."

    "reviewText": "I decided to give this app a try because I generally enjoy retro 2d shooter games. Before installing, I noticed that the only permission the app asks for is vibration control, which is fine. Opening the game takes you to the simple start screen and the only option is to press to begin. Seemed odd that there were no instructions or options at all. Played a couple times to get the hang of it. Literally, played twice... then I was bored. The second time through I realized that nothing changed and there was nothing to work forward to.The game has decent graphics, mediocre background music for the style of game, okay controls that tend to lag when things start to speed up. The kicker, however, is that there is nothing that makes me want to keep playing; No level upgrades, no achievements, just repetition.It's a good start, I'll give it that. But the game mechanics need some serious work. This app needs to go back into the oven for a while. I'll check back later to see if this app becomes more developed that just some half-baked free app."

A top down scroller, Space War HD is just one of the crowd, with nothing special to offer and lacking in many areas.  The \"HD\" graphics are, well, not so great.  Sound effects?  None.  It does have two background soundtracks to choose from, which are decent enough.  The controls are pretty responsive, but are finger or trackball driven only.  Options for Space War HD are very minimal, there is no help section, and there is nothing for online score posting.On my Epic, it ran just great.  Everything worked as it should.  My tablet though was a whole other story.  Space War HD failed to scale up properly, leaving smeared graphics along the right and bottom edges.  The soundtrack failed to ever come on, making the game that much more dull.  The final nail in the coffin was that it loved to force close.  Ouch.After having reviewed so many games just like Space War HD, all of which are free, I can't say I'd recommend spending the $1 to get this title.I hope you found this review helpful, and if not, feel free to leave comments/questions."

The animation is too basic to wow a five year old.Oh, and I'm pretty sure the developer may get sued by the RIAA for including remixed copyrighted music (anyone else recognize the Axel Foley theme?)Basically, this would be okay for a free, alpha version; definitely NOT a paid apk for any price."

    "reviewText": "As has been mentioned in some of the other reviews, this game's biggest downfall is the controls. Seems fairly obvious that the controls are not being processed properly because of a couple of things:1. The ship's movement is jumpy, rather than smoothly tracking when you're tracing your finger across the screen.2. The movement gets impaired even further when there are more things on the screen - makes the first boss battle basically impossible between the sprites for the ships and the barrage of fireballs from the boss vessel itself.I enjoy a mindless top down shooter, but this game's flaws go beyond just a need for polish to actually impairing the gameplay. If the author can address the controls, I think it will go a long way to improving the game.Secondary suggestions: make it obvious what are 'good' things and what are 'bad' things; I basically killed myself the first time through because I kept attempting to pick up what must be space mines or something. Maybe include a graphic page describing the power ups and what they do. There's actually a good game here, it just needs some help to get to it. Unfortunately, it is unlikely that most people are likely to give it a second chance even if these issues are addressed because there is a constant flood of cheap time waster games coming onto the market.Ultimate suggestion to the author - take what you've learned from this experience along with the constructive criticism that people have left you, and make a new, better game. (Space War HD 2: The Revenge, heh)"

I don't like the weapon upgrades lasting two seconds max (some are one timers) especially since it auto fires. Of course it could just be me trying to pick up a Space Mine because the damn things look more like a bonus than a threat like the asteroids do. Graphics are above average and the game shows potential. I might check back in the future to see if it has been programmed more for my liking."

After a while you get tired of everyone acting like entitled children when it comes to free app of the day. however in the case of this app most of the reviews were right. I downloaded this game after I read a review that said the axel foley theme was in the music and he was right. This game sucks, the music is lame or copyrighted, the announcers voice is really annoying, there's no option to use power ups like star laser when you choose, rather they are used immediately for you. In addition when your ship blows up I'm fairly certain they used a gunshot sound effect. Besides these flaws there is a technical problem where the ship is a full inch above where I place my finger rather than where I place it. With no option to calibrate I'm uninstalling this from my Droid Incredible 2. Some games have charm because they're old or retro or just so poorly made that they're fun. This game is none of the above. Save yourself the time and skip it."

You can set the bombs in the same place and just blow them up several times and get a different result each time. The auto zoom when picking up a bomb is extremely annoying though, if there was an option to disable that it'd be a 3 or 4 star game. As it is, there's no way to see the full structure when placing a bomb as it zooms in as soon as you pick up a bomb, and if you want to see the whole structure you have to manually double tap to zoom out after every bomb. And unless you have a really small screen, mines only about 3 inches, a LG Optimus V, bomb placement doesn't look like it'd be an issue zoomed out.So if the developer is reading, please make a quick update to allow the auto zoom to be turned off."

Each time it told me the same thing, that the user name was already taken. This is impossible. Obviously this app has a bad bug or wont work on the Kindle Fire HD. Either way, I dont give a dam. I deleted the crappy app, and wont even think about ever trying it again. See ya Trillian. Whoops...Trillian is already taken, sorry lol."

It will download it, but I get an error message every time I try to install the app. It's not like I'm doing anything wrong, here, since all I'm doing is clicking 'download', waiting until it's done, then clicking 'install' and I immediately get the message. I've deleted it and tried to re-download, several times, and the same thing happens. I didn't do any research to see if maybe it's not supported on the Kindle, but just in case someone else like me hopes it will work, I figured I'd at least leave a review letting folks know I haven't been able to get it to work for me."

When I saw Photo Enhance Pro was a freebie today, I jumped right on it.  Even happier when it was compatible with both my devices.  The enjoyment was short lived though, as Photo Enhance Pro simply couldn't deliver.One of Photo Enhance Pro's main claims to fame is its ability to automatically enhance your pics.  I used 10 different pictures from my collection, a mix of good lighting, bad lighting, excellent images, and not so good ones.  In each and every one, I'm unhappy to say the enhancements delivered looked very unnatural and resulting in images that looked worse the original. Going through each level of enhancement produced the same result.  So much for that.  Photo Enhance Pro allows you to try you hand at fixing up your pics yourself, but only offers a basic set of four tools. Using the tools to manually enhance produced better results than the automatic enhancement with some effort.  The tools use sliders without any notation, which makes dialing in a repeat effect can be troublesome.  This carries over into the cropping tool.  Though the tool has several ways to ensure you keep the right scale, it doesn't tell you the size the resulting image will afterwards.In summary, Photo Enhance Pro is very unimpressive.  Several other photo editors offer more functionality, better tools, and a much more attractive price.  Sorry guys, try again."

Any cell phone photographers would want real editing would be well served to spend just $1.99 on Pic Say Pro which offers dozens more tools with far better results. Additionally, for HDR, spend $2.99 on HDR Camera+ for the real thing for a grand total of the same price of this underperforming app."

Tried at several stores and none of them could read the barcode off of my phone.More and more stores are using self checkout, so if the scanner cant read your info from your phone, there isn't a person to read the number to.

The ball already starts at random spots and you have no way to move it where you want or need it to be, but Tilted just makes it even worse. The ball is slow and very little you do influences its movement. Response is sluggish, the instructions are bad, you can't opt out of unplayable levels. I tried it like 3 times, then uninstalled. Believe me, you don't want this game unless you thrive on frustration."

The graphics look ok, but the animation of the ball hitting the pins is way off and I don't think the physics is done at all correctly. For instance, the ball will appear to be about to strike the center pin, yet it somehow misses and hits pins to the side instead. Those &quot;falling&quot; pins move neither left nor right.Further, the control mechanism is off. Flick as hard and fast as you like, but the maximum speed the ball will attain tops out way too quickly, often not fast enough in the twisty level.And finally, don't be fooled into thinking that you can play an actual game of bowling. The ball starts in a random spot that you have to deal with, there is no spin/hook that you can control, and you have to follow the predefined levels."

This game has a pad with hooked ends which allows you to guide the deflection of the ball with a bit more precision.Controls - You control the pad movement with your finger.  Tracking was a bit jittery, not precise as it should be.  There is an in game toggle for the sound but no pause button.  Sound can be turned on and off during the game or before you start, but the button isn't very responsive while you're playing.Graphics - Yawn.  Simplistic at best, about the quality of and Atari 2600Sounds - Only two sounds total and I found myself turning the sound off fairly soon.Stability & Performance - Overall, the game did not play smoothly.  Watching the ball move, I could see a jerky motion to it, matching my experience with moving the pad around.  Sounds didn't come in at the right time consistently.  Game crashed out the first time I attempted to post my score.Extras - You can post your score to a global leader board.  Leader board is divided into Day, Week, Month, and All Time"

What drew me to it was that it supported Windows word files, meaning I could upload a paper I had already been working on and add to it or complete it.  Well as you are typing if you begin to delete a word it will try to spell correct the word as you delete it making it time consuming and frustrating to say the least.  The Windows word compatibility only works for using our editing an existing file. Once you save it the file can no longer be used in the Microsoft word program.  So all the work you did hoping to only have to be done once will in fact have to be done over again to save it to a usable word format.  You are better off to use pen and paper as you'll have to write it twice anyway."

It's how the operating system works, and it actually works well. Stick with all the other reviewers, and stay away from task killers. You can already go and kill programs individually in settings>applications. Religiously killing tasks, thinking you're making your phone last longer...is a mistake, a big one. A lot of developers actually think, at this point(android 2.2+), they do more harm than good. If you find some comfort in having one of these on your phone, at least go with one with some nice additional features like advanced task killer...But i'll say it again, try to stay away from task killers.Droid X"

I was figuring I'd get statistics on qwerty keyboards and the like. Instead, it turns out that there's a star by that name and I got tons of info on that, instead. Unfortunately, I wasn't interested, but had no way of telling the app that it had the wrong qwerty. It should offer choices, like wikipedia offers the disambiguation pages.So, my second search was more specialized. &quot;texas adult protective services&quot; should give some information, any information, about that department. But according to this app, no such combination of words exists.I've done other searches with this engine in the past with similar results. Like the title of my review says, this app just isn't very useful for finding things."

It then grays out the area dropping more jewels into place.The object is to gray out an entire tetris like piece to clear it (similar to the alchemy puzzle game)Once again the game is unique but the lackluster graphics make it borderline unplayable."

    "reviewText": "Here's the frustrating bug (for slider users only): While playing the game, put your phone to sleep. If you then wake it up by sliding the keyboard open, to answer a text for example, the game will be momentarily forced into landscape mode and then reverts to the title screen. The \"resume game\" option in the menus is greyed out and you've lost your progress in the game.Even without that bug, though, this wouldn't be worth five bucks. No tower defense game is, at this point. Anyone with a flash-capable browser has their choice of dozens for free, and there are dozens more on the Android market. Since they all play more or less the same, the differentiating factors are things like price and polish. So, on to the polish: The \"retro\" graphics are glowy in a Tron sort of way, but if the developer was going for a simulated vector graphic look in the vein of Geometry Wars, as it appears from the sprite designs, it needed a higher frame rate. If something like Angry Birds with zooming and rotation can be as smooth as it is, this should be smoother still. Then there's the \"press menu to start game\" thing, because apparently the developer was really impressed with his static splash screen and didn't want to disturb it... except for that permanent \"press menu to start game\" sitting on top of it.This is a somewhat competent tower defense game, but those are a dime a dozen. Its differentiating factors don't add up and it has a very annoying bug. I'm giving it two stars because it's not completely broken.Full disclosure: I got the game when it was the free app of the day, but haven't had a chance to try it till today."

Check out my reviews on those by just clicking my name above this review here and look around my reviews and you will find it.Thanks."

It was causing my flash to rapidly open and close for no reason.  I also don't understand why it needs to mount and unmount storage devices.  Really strange.  I'm sure this would be great if it worked properly though.  I actually bought Paper Camera last night.  Well worth the half off price of 99&cent;.  I spent about 30 minutes playing around with it after purchase.  It has awesome looking filters/effects.  It's easily the best camera app I've ever had.  Hopefully this one will get a few upgrades and become better.  DROIDX"

All you can see on the screen is the upcoming obstacles and you work to avoid them.  The game is fun for about 3 minutes.Luckily they put in a \"Tilt Sensitivity\" adjustment which other games should also have and this made the game more fun for about 5 minutes.  I just don't think there is enough action or fun in this game to spend a lot of time on it.When compared to all of the other good games out there, this one is really lacking.  If it wasn't for the \"Tilt Sensitivity\" adjustment it would have been a 1 star rating.  This will be in the cloud today to make room for better games!"

On my Fire, it's not really challenging at all and there is very little replay value.  Perhaps this title was designed for children or older phones with small screens and perhaps it's more fun in those situations.There really isn't much \"game\" here.  You automatically move forward and you have to tilt to avoid trees.  The other mode consists of pushing the screen to move forward and letting go to slow down.  Or in the last mode, collect powerups.I like how it successfully captures a creepy vibe, it does this pretty well.  However that's the only thing it really does do well.I'm glad it was Free App of the Day today otherwise I would have regretted buying this.  There are many great apps selling for 99 cents."

    "reviewText": "I was really hoping this would be the 'next best thing'  after temple run, for my kindle fire. no such luck. even after reading reviews, I was still optimistically hoping people just weren't appreciating a nice 'endless run' game... but no, the reviews were right. this game isn't fun, its just annoying. I had no problem with tilt or sound, and the graphics were nice... so I gave it 'one' star (two technically but as its not possible to give zero stars, one star is like zero). other than that, the game is generic, boring, and irritating. all three modes offer pretty much the same thing, save one minor difference, none of which make the game any better. I hope the devs take these reviews into consideration, because a dead runner 2 could possibly be a sweet game."

I tried to change the category of pictures, and after 'thinking' for a few minutes, it told me that \"categories are not availiable\". They'd been there before that, so I think it's just a very slow app. I thought that it might be the internet on my phone, but I pulled up several other internet-based apps that worked just fine. The app is just slow. Big disappointment. (This was on a T-Mobile Sidekick 4G - in case maybe it just doesn't like this particular phone)"

Someone needs to explain to the dev that the whole appeal of minigolf is to make obstacles entertaining, not a punishment that kicks you in the berries and steals your wallet. I forced myself to stumble through 5 full rounds to give the app a real chance to see if there was a decent game buried in there but only found myself wincing as the difficulty ramped up. They're well beyond &quot;challenging&quot; and deep into &quot;punishing&quot; territory. Trying to softly take ten shots to keep a ball on a curving little strip of grass surrounded by water with no other obstacles is just plain lazy design to snag a buck.I guarantee the dev has zero intention of playing the game himself and as others have said, I'm pretty sure I played this game years ago on my pocket pc and thought it sucked then too."

You come across one that you wish to read the rules about. There is no button or anything telling you the rules. Instead, you have to hit the back button to go back to the main screen, then read the rules there. Why? Going back to the main screen is ridiculously stupid. It would make much more sense to have a button on the same page where you are examining the list of games, that says \"Rules\".I have to be honest here.250+ Solitaireis a much better free solitaire app. It allows you to not only get the rules straight away, but also you can view a demo in action of each game.

Second is that I wanted something that was competent and had a good UI.  On paper, SafeWallet is supposed to fill both of these requirements.  It probably does, once you get it working.It's not working for me.  In fact, anyone with a Kindle Fire using the Amazon store version of SafeWallet also know it's not working for them.  Because of an error on the software developer's side a fatal error was introduced in the 1.1.9 version.  The figured it out and several days later, after they were notified  by users, they fixed the problem.Cool, right?  Yes, if you use the Android Marketplace.  No, if you use Amazon.  Kindle Fire doesn't use Android Marketplace.  See where I'm going?  I've been well into a week with this problem.  The developer insists they are doing what they can, but that the problem is on Amazon's side.  I haven't heard anything back yet from my favorite company, so who knows what's going on really...Is this an indictment on SBSH SafeWallet?  Yes.  A fatal error should not go out in any release.  Quality control?  And having the users alert you to the problem?  That shouldn't happen either.  I'm pretty dissappointed with Amazon as well.Once I get this product working, I'm sure it will be just fine and I suspect the product will work as claimed.  But I've already started my backup plan for moving data out of SafeWallet and into KeePass should this happen again."

It was fairly easy to understand which is why I would have given this three stars instead of two. The only reason I did give two stars is that the menu to scroll through the different time zones was VERY sensitive, so it was extremely easy to want to scroll a tiny bit down the list when the menu thinks you want to scroll all the way to the end. It was very frustrating, which is unfortunate because the app was okay otherwise."

It's supposed to have an &quot;easy&quot; user interface. I'm a homeschooling mother of an autistic son with a kindergartener in school. I am converting our lives from &quot;traditional&quot; to what can best be described as all natural. I also suffer from a joint disorder so there are lots of doctor's appointment to keep up with for my son and I. Right now I have a gigantic wicker basket full of binders and folders to try to keep my household managed. I wanted something easy that I could use that would keep track of EVERYTHING, that would allow me to take photo memos and voice memos. This seemed perfect.However, the interface is NOT user friendly. It won't let me delete notebooks. I have four emails in my inbox asking me to connect to my computer so it can &quot;sync&quot; which I'm wary of. You can upgrade but it's not a &quot;for life&quot; type of upgrade that will sit in your Amazon Cloud Drive until you die...it's a subscription.I think that it should've been made clear that this app was really geared more toward a business person who can write off a monthly subscription. I have a tight budget. I don't mind paying $4, $5, even $10 for an app that would give me the functionality that I need but not a monthly subscription.This just isn't a good app even though it has all the features I need because it's really just a trial before you get the subscription. I'm hoping I can get my stuff off here before I delete it. If you can afford the monthly subscription, I'm sure it's awesome."

In comparison to springpad: evernote has cleaner, easier to use features. springpad's notebook page is better looking and u have a social feature where u can follow other notebooks; I did not see that on evernote.  evernote has a few 1ups over springpad, but I wont use it anyway because I don't see why it would need access to so Much personal information.

    "reviewText": "I have used Evernote since about 2010 I think.  I don't think I could get along without it.  I used to use it on the iOS platform.  However, I recently went to the Android platform using a Kindle HDX 8.9 and it now removes all of the formatting in my notes.  I can have wonderfully formatted notes made on my PC and iOS devices.  Some of them years old.  But, once they touch my Android device they are ruined.Prior to this I would have wished I could give Evernote a 10 out of 5 stars.  Evernote has become my right hand.  But, since moving to a Android tablet (Kindle Fire HDX 8.9)  Evernote has been a nightmare and support has been silent.  that is Evernote support not Amazon.UPDATE 5-20-14  The title of my review used to be \"love it but...\"  I finally heard from Evernote support.  Apparently they will not support the Kindle version of the Evernote application.  They wrote that It is fine for me to read my notes in the Kindle version but they recommend I do NOT attempt to edit my notes on the Kindle.  They wrote the Kindle version will only operate in \"many ways\" and it will not be supported or updated.  This is incredibly disappointing.  As I wrote above.  Evernote is my right hand.  I am a stroke survivor with memory and cognitive deficits.  I have come to rely on Evernote and my phone and tablets to keep notes and photos as part of my lost memory.  I try to stay objective in my reviews.  But, this actually makes me feel physically sick!  Losing Evernote on my Kindle is as if I have lost part of my memory again.  Amazon had to know this when I emailed them and they emailed me back.This is a link to the email Evernote sent me.  You will have to copy and past it into a browser.http://1drv.ms/1ob463T"

Moving from laptop to desktop to office, it is all pretty seamless and the types of input methods available, cover just about all bases.  However, in its foray into the mobile platform, Evernote falls flat on its face.All the great note-taking features found on the desktop are reduced to a clunky, limited and unreliable state on the mobile platform (tablets and phones). Notes frequently fail to save, disappear or simply refuse to sync with the desktop version. Half-baked doesn't begin to cover it.I am actively seeking a replacement product. I can't believe I actually considered paying for this."

I had to manually remove it with a third party application. Honestly, this is worth a star demerit but I don't hate Evernote.Pros: I enjoyed typing my notes directly into the Kindle Fire (KF) app, like using a simple word processor. I like that Evernote synched my KF to an insecure web server, to my desktop, and to a web interface. It was an easy way to transfer image and text files.Cons: It was hard to cut and paste text on the Kindle Fire (KF). What I did instead was create multiple notes that I was going to patch together later on a desktop. That is, until I lost one my biggest notes. Now my heart is crying. I'm not sure how much of the sync error is due to Evernote or Kindle Fire's memory, but regardless, the two apps combined makes me wince.Verdict: I just deleted the app.If you're going to use Evernote: Make sure to have a back up version in another app!"

    "reviewText": "First the good things.  There are Evernote apps available in just about all the app stores, including Amazon, so it's easy to find and install.  It works well with notes you create, and doesn't require installing an application on your computer to view and manage them.The bad news is it does a terrible job with attachments to notes.  The equation editor on my Kindle Fire HD can be backed up to Evernote, but it changes the file name to an internal Evernote GUID, and even changes the file extension to something completely random.  Their competitor Dropbox has no problem with this, so I would recommend using that if you're backing up or sharing anything other than simple text notes.  You'll need to install it from the Dropbox web site because the Android app isn't in Amazon's app store, but it's worth the extra step."

Now it requires you to log in using a WiFi connection, which is fine if you have an available signal 24-7.  If you don't, which is usually the case when you're out and about, then you can't access any of your notes.  You can't even try to make a note if there is no WiFi signal.  Even if you have a signal you have to log in before you can do anything and if you forget your password and try to retrieve it through the app it won't allow you to.Overall it's great if you have a 24-7 WiFi connection, if you don't then pass this up.  I gave up and deleted the app after several attempts on my home pc to try and set up a password and it failed."

    "reviewText": "Okay, I needed a free, basic note tool for my Kindle Fire that would save on my Kindle for offline use, and sync when it is online so I have a back-up and can use the app on my work and home Windows machines.  Evernote has great reviews, so I thought I woud give it a try.I think the biggest problem I had was user experience on my Kindle.  I found the interface a bit confusing, and everytime I tried to add a notebook, it would look like it was saving the new notebook, but would not show up on my list of notebooks.  I could be wrong, but it looks like there is a limit of three notebooks for non-paid subscriptions (or for offline use maybe).The buttons didn't seem very intuitive to me either (placement or look/feel).Anyway, I wasn't using it because it was taking me too long to figure out, so I went looking for another app.  I found SpringPad, which seems a little less popular than Evernote, but for me, it is exactly what I have been looking for and more.So if you are looking for an alternative to EverNote, try SpringPad.  Its free, and it is great for organizing personal notes!"

Also, the horoscope text is white and the background is very light, making it difficult to read the first couple sentences.  If the interface was updated for KF I would raise my rating.

And how do I know once they have it in there that they'll behave and close the open hole they drilled in my device to siphon my information? At the very least, READ and opt out on the settings page.

    "reviewText": "It's fine that there are plenty of brush shapes, but there are a lot of novelty shapes. There is no soften tool, so blending is done by changing colors frequently. There is no hardness option, but presets have different edges which help with blending. I basically need layers, offset cursor, and an eyedropper. I can't move layers. The cursor has a little lag at the lowest settings. If the eyedropper is set to appear when hovering the cursor, it appears when moving the cursor. This makes the program unusable. Support said they'd look into the speed at which the cursor has to move before the eyedropper request is canceled. It's been a month, and the obvious bug is still present. I, like a lot of artists, pull colors from the artwork and the pallet we create on the canvas. Not being able to do this on the fly makes the program unusable. The other way to get the eyedropper is to go through 3 steps. Initial color selection is 4 steps. When I mentioned this to support, he said I should have bought the pro version if I'd wanted to pick colors in 2 steps. LOL. The pro version wasn't available for the Fire at the time. Why would I be sold a crippled program and then be told to give more money for a program that is more streamlined? Why would I want to \"upgrade\" when the developers can't fix a simple bug. The support guy suggested that all that had to be done was to change one number in the program."

Might be  more fun for 8 year old girls. Most people will fun this mighty lame.The good news for FAOTD reviewers is the permissions will be within the acceptable range preventing the standard dialogues.  I guess it's worth 2 stars - 1 for 8 year old girls (they need games too) and the other for preventing the permission war."

    "reviewText": "I got this as the free app of the day, so I'm more than glad to do an honest review. It installed fine on my EVO 3D and it plays ok. The biggest problem right off the bat is that it doesn't fit my screen fully. Ok, not exactly a deal breaker in this situation, but had I purchased it for $3 it would be. I see people complaining about not swiping patterns correctly. I would disagree. It's was very responsive. The music, eh. It could be better. My biggest complaint is that it's way too easy for me or probably any adult. Seriously, you can score points by connecting 2 pieces in a row. How hard is that? They're all over the game board. But I can see how kids might love this.Final thought. This is not for me. I've already uninstalled it. It's not the worst game I've tried, but far from great or worth the money. That's why I give it 2 stars. Had I paid $3 for it, I'd be really pissed. Those who let their kids play on their handheld devices might find value in this."
